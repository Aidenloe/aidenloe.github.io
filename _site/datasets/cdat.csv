Firms such as Rolls Royce, GE, Xerox and Siemens are remaining competitive by creating additional value to their customers through the services they provide, and taking a share of this value. Over the years, providing services embedded within products' offerings has gradually become a fundamental business constituent for manufacturing organisations. 

Understanding the organisational transformation required to operate in this way has been an enduring challenge to both researchers and practitioners, and only a few notable contributions address the topic. Some prominent scholars have set out the benefits of, and barriers to, undertaking the transformation , while others describe the state of being a 'servitized' manufacturer and the impact this delivers, but few really deal holistically with the dynamics of the process of transformation itself, or distinguish what is particular about servitization over general organisational change. Although there are significant literature and theoretical frameworks in the general field of organisational change, no models exist to explain the servitization transformation process.

This project addresses this gap by consolidating the servitization knowledge base from the perspective of organisational change. Our integrative approach in this project will complement our goal of conducting a broad and inclusive study of the servitization transformation, which leads to identifying the stages of transformation, the key factors and forces that influence such transformation, and the key tasks and decisions in each stage. The purpose of the project is, therefore, to document the transformation of a manufacturing organisation as it moves towards competing through advanced services. In order to do this, the following research questions will be addressed:

(i) What stages might an organisation expect to go through as it progresses towards servitization? What are the critical decisions and activities that occur in each stage? (Process)
(ii) What are the principal factors and forces that affect progression through these stages? (Context) 
(iii) How do these stages and forces interplay as a model to demonstrate pathways towards servitization? (Content)","In addition to the academic audiences outlined above, this research is expected to have a direct impact upon three separate non-academic groups, as well as the general public interested in manufacturing issues. 

The findings will have direct relevance, and provide strategic guidance, to the executives of those firms that are currently moving towards competing through advanced services and servitization. Product-focused manufacturing firms have realised that in a turbulent financial environment, servitization can certainly assist them in achieving a sustainable competitive advantage. However, due to the influence of different factors including organisational structure, customer demands and behaviour, market saturation, the triadic nature of service supply chains, and diffusion of innovation, the most challenging question is &quot;how should we transform?&quot;. By developing and proposing the pathways, actions and decision points that will lead them towards servitization, this project will greatly impact such firms. 

The development of the pathways will be informed by the established adopters of servitization, and the analysis of their transformation journey will, in turn, provide them with a more rationalised understanding of the ongoing process of servitization. These companies have followed emergent, organic strategies and now find themselves to be seen as exemplars of servitized firms. In all cases, they are continuing to evolve and develop their services strategies, and the systematic capturing of the stages that they have been through will assist them in revisiting some of the decisions and actions that have been taken, and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their future plans and projects. 

Finally, the findings of the proposed research are likely to have practical implications for those parties helping both large and small firms to address their sustainability and scalability. Having surveyed 76 SMEs we identified that the principal barriers to their transformation towards servitization were financial and contractual complexities. Financial sector companies (e.g. banks) and legal firms have, in recent years, become much more interested in supporting these companies with servitization. This project will help these parties to understand what servitization is, how organisations approach it, and what stages organisations will go through. It will also help the companies to understand in which stage(s) of their transformation they most need the help from third parties such as banks and lawyers.

These impacts are expected to be delivered towards the identified groups through: (1) direct contacts with the case organisations throughout the study, (2) dissemination workshops, and (3) engagement and presentations in industry conferences and events.","Ali Ziaee Bigdeli","Management & Business Studies","Manufact.

For example, one may be interested in studying spillovers and externalities in technology diffusion across firms and industries, or impacts of friendship networks on the educational outcomes of students. There has been a growing interest in the discipline of economics to account for such interdependence via explicit economic modelling. Interactions between agents arise naturally in most social and economic research that often influence decisions taken by governments and firms. Ignoring such interactions in empirical analysis when they are in fact present would lead to misleading findings and poor prediction accuracy. Recognising this has led to new developments in both theoretical modelling and statistical techniques. In particular, spatial econometrics, the field that develops methodological tools to study or allow for such interactions, has witnessed rapid advancements. 

While the idea of interdependence between economic agents is highly intuitive, quantitative modelling requires explicit mathematical formulations of such relationships, inevitably imbuing some degree of arbitrariness into any given analysis. Practitioners typically face uncertainty about many, if not all, aspects of model specification and the current absence of testing methodology to detect model misspecification undermines confidence in the reliability of subsequent econometric analysis. This project aims to produce much-needed testing procedures to assess correct specification of models, which is a crucial assumption made in theoretical econometric works to obtain validity of existing estimation and inferential methods. Such testing methods will be a major advancement to the field. 

We aim to establish solid theoretical foundation for a ground-breaking development of specification testing procedures in a spatial setting, and to produce user-friendly automated codes that implement our tests in popular software programs used by empirical researchers. To do so, we will rely on an existing work of PI, Co-I and P.C.B. Phillips, and extend its results to continue developing testing procedures in spatial models, which present significant challenges. Careful theoretical studies need to be undertaken to refine the tests to optimise the power properties. 

The main benefits of our research would be helping practitioners avoid inconsistent estimates and misleading conclusions arising from fitting misspecified models and also achieve more accurate forecasts of future outcomes. This is crucial as fitting different models to the same data could often lead to contrasting findings, hence selecting the right model is of paramount importance in empirical research. Our procedures will help practitioners choose among competing models and will have practical implications via improving the quality of econometric analysis and prediction on which policy recommendations and decisions taken by governments and the private sector are based. The applicability of spatial econometrics and our methodologies extends well beyond economics to other social sciences, such as regional science, urban planning, quantitative geography, environmental studies and mathematical social network (in fact, researchers from these disciples actively contribute to developments in spatial econometrics). These are fields that generate and foster active interdisciplinary research and have major policy impacts.

Our testing procedures can and should become a routine and integral part of any spatial econometric applications, as practitioners are inclined to test the critical assumption of correct specification that underpins the validity of their findings. To this end, the creation and dissemination of automated codes will play a critical role. Given the complexity of this task, the research assistance in coding we apply for as part of this grant is crucial for the success of the project","The main non-academic beneficiaries of this project will be economic analysts at government agencies, central banks, international organizations such as IMF and World Bank, and in private sector, for example those working on forecasts of house prices and housing demand at banks and building societies. These practitioners carry out empirical research to produce evidence-based policy assessment, forecast future economic variables and simulate contrasting policy outcomes based on insights into the real world gained from statistical analysis of data. Their works influence policy recommendations and decisions taken by governments and private sector. 
Spatial econometric techniques enable practitioners to incorporate possible interdependence between countries, regions, firms and individuals into their empirical analysis. There is a growing recognition of the need for such spatial modelling in wider research community outside academia, see e.g. ECB working papers by Ozyurt and coauthors (2014, 2015), IMF working papers Baldacci et al. (2011) and Silver and Graf (2014) and working papers of Millo and coauthors (2011, 2014) of Generali group, the third biggest insurance firm in the world. Failing to account for these interactions when they are in fact present would lead to misleading findings arising from biased/inconsistent estimates and poorer forecast performance. Ozyurt (2014) of ECB enumerates a large number of recent real-estate studies which &quot;show that the incorporation of the observed spatial relationship improves the accuracy of the predicted market values and time indicators&quot;. 
To date, theoretical justifications for estimation and inference procedures in spatial econometric models all rely crucially on the strong assumption that the model is correctly specified. Confidence in subsequent analysis is undermined by the lack of testing procedure to assess this key assumption. The present project fills this hole in the current set of available techniques. This will enable practitioners to make better-informed model specification, generate greater confidence in the validity of subsequent econometric analysis and improve precision of forecasts. 
For example, understanding of house price movement is enhanced by accounting for interdependence between houses within and across different neighbourhoods. While this idea is highly intuitive, formal modelling of such interaction requires the practitioner to choose mathematical forms of such relation and also how determinants of house price other than that of neighbouring units affect the outcome, which inevitably are subject to arbitrariness. The present project will produce the much-needed testing procedures to assess whether the model specification being used is acceptable in the light of data. Such testing is crucial in any application of spatial econometric techniques.
As with any emerging academic field, it takes time and resources for academic advancement to seep through to wider community. The leading initiatives for dissemination in this field are Spatial Econometric Association's (SEA) annual 4-week summer schools for practitioners and graduate students and its annual conference which attracts heavy participation from practitioners. We are already in touch with the SEA about our research and possible collaboration in future to effectively disseminate the project's output given its synergy with the existing methodology of inference and estimation. By joining forces with these exiting efforts, this project will contribute to the process via offering a key advancement to the field of overcoming one of its most severe current limitations. We therefore anticipate the project's impacts will long outlive its duration.","Jungyoon Lee","Economics","Econometrics","Economics","Financial economics",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Alongside the legal trade in plants, the profitability of the market also boosted illegal markets. Wild plant crimes have long been a focus of concern mainly in conservation science. In criminology, while the illegal trade in wild animals (and animal parts eg ivory) is receiving increasing attention, the illegal trade in plants has so far been under-investigated. However, wild plant trafficking threatens and destroys numerous species and important natural resources (Herbig &amp; Joubert 2006) and hinders the rule of law and security as profits are also used to finance other forms of trafficking (WWF 2016). The Internet has increased the illegal trade in wild plants, facilitating the encounter of supply and demand; no matter how highly specialised the market in certain wild plants, it is much easier to find potential buyers or sellers online than in the physical world (Lavorgna 2014a). There is consensus that the policing of such a criminal activity is still scarce and poorly resourced (Nurse 2011; Elliot 2012; Lavorgna 2014a; Lemieux 2014; Runhovde 2016). A major challenge is the fact that law enforcement agencies have limited training opportunities and lack of equipment and specific expertise to counter effectively this illegal trade (CITES2016). In this context, the question of how can we best control and prevent this criminal market needs to be addressed.

The proposed project combines innovative and cross-disciplinary ways of analysing online marketplaces for the illegal trade in endangered plants and analyses of existing policing practices to assist law enforcement in the detection and investigation of illegal trades of endangered plants. It focuses on the UK, which serves as a major transit and destination market for the European region (EU Commission2016).

The result of this research will be of significant importance for the work of law enforcement (eg national wildlife crime units, custom officers) in combating the illegal trade in endangered plants (in both its online and offline elements), disrupt criminal networks involved in such trade, and preserve biodiversity. In line with the latest WWF position paper (WWF 2016), the project fosters the improvement of awareness and technical capacity in investigation and prosecution services for wildlife crimes. The proposed approach will identify and disseminate best practice for other researchers and law enforcement officers with an interest in online crime markets and wildlife policing; in addition, it will improve our understanding of the online marketplaces and the offline market routes for the trafficking of endangered plants into Western countries, supporting new avenues of investigation. By integrating insights and expertise from criminology, computer sciences and conservation science, the proposed project has also important implications for demonstrating interdisciplinary methodological developments.

The research is structured around three cumulative work-packages (WP). WP1 comprises analysis of economic, social and geographical dynamics of a sample of online marketplaces active in the UK and associated with the illegal trade of endangered plants. WP2 focuses on the policing of this criminal activity by mapping current law enforcement practices and interventions, assessing their effectiveness in the light of the findings of WP1, and identifying law enforcement's needs for more effective policing. WP3 develops and tests a digital package of resources to assist law enforcement investigations into illegal trades of endangered plants in the UK. In doing so, it promotes engagement and effective communication with a non-academic audience (law enforcement, NGOs, botanic gardens, international institutions). The Royal Botanic Garden (Kew, the scientific authority for CITES plant trade in the UK) and the UK Border Force are formal non-academic partners to this project.","Who will benefit from this research?
Our approach integrates criminology, computer science and conservation science to improve our understanding of plant trafficking towards the UK and develop a package of digital resources to assist law enforcement in investigating the criminal market in endangered plants. This is of interest for national law enforcement bodies working to counter this illegal trade (e.g. the National Wildlife Crime Units within the UK Police Force), as well as for national and international policy makers and law enforcement agencies looking to review (traditional and cyberspace) policing approaches (e.g. the UK Partnership for Action Against Wildlife Crime, the Police Advisory board for England and Wales) and NGOs (e.g. TRAFFIC, WWF). 

How will they benefit from this research?
Our impact strategy aims to target UK enforcement agencies to raise awareness of the illegal trade in endangered plants and assist their policing strategies. Ultimately, &quot;FloraGuard&quot; will: 
1) Significantly improve the understanding of socio-economic and geo-social patterns in the online-facilitated trade of endangered plants. Currently this is an under-researched area of criminality. We expect &quot;FloraGuard&quot; to provide an up-to-date snapshot of the marketplace, how it operates and how policing interventions could make the most effective difference to disrupt this. 
2) Create a unique dataset of online illegal wildlife trade activity available today, which will be of immediate relevance for other researchers interested in this area.
3) Create and support a community of experts and practitioners crossing national, institutional and sector boundaries. The network is designed to outlast the duration of the project, providing a lasting impact for the countering of illegal plant trafficking in the UK.
4) Promote knowledge exchange and capacity-building for law enforcement. By sharing the digital tools, law enforcement agencies will be able to run analyses of the online aspects of the criminal market for themselves.

For 1) and 2), our methodology allows us to build an up-to-date dataset for selected online marketplaces for endangered plants. This approach has potential applications for other forms of online criminality (e.g. arms trafficking). The data collected will be released to authorised parties starting from month 15, so that law enforcement and cyber-security professionals in areas other than the illegal wildlife trade can build upon our work.

For 3) and 4), we will engage with Project Partners throughout the duration of the project, with their ideas and expertise shaping the project outcomes. This is important as we want to motivate our Partners to champion our policy paper and the digital package of resources in the medium term and see them shape future governmental policy. Bilateral meetings will discuss progress, methodological issues and preliminary results at key milestones (see Gantt Charts). Additional online meetings will take place to keep partners updated and get feedback. We will also establish a secure social network accessible from the project website for sharing updates and facilitate the direct involvement of partners in developing the digital resources.

The final part of each WP will focus on delivering policy level impact. We will use the expertise at PublicPolicyISouthampton to create &quot;science-to-policy&quot; outputs to be distributed via the project website and a final workshop in Southampton. We will also work with our Partners to provide briefing for governmental committees and charities including the Environment Agency, the Police Advisory Board for England and Wales and the British Wildlife Rehabilitation Council. At the final workshop, champions from each Partner will be identified to ensure our outputs are followed through to include our results in the next UK Border Agency strategy and the UK Government Commitment to Action on the illegal wildlife trade.","Stuart Middleton","Ecol, biodivers. & systematics","Info. & commun.

In the UK, nearly 25% of employed mothers and 35% of employed fathers have nonstandard schedules. A growing body of research has pointed to the adverse impact of these schedules on child and parental health. Given that work-related stress, depression and anxiety accounted for 11.7 million working days lost in the UK in 2015-16, we need to gather more evidence on the implications of parents' nonstandard work schedules on parents' health, family life, and children's health. This ground-breaking research is the first in the UK to make these significant contributions:
-An examination of the social and demographic profiles of mothers and fathers working nonstandard schedules
-Provide new evidence on the immediate and longitudinal consequences of parental nonstandard work schedules on children's health and development, family life, and parental mental and overall health
-An investigation of family characteristics that may explain the links between nonstandard work and children's and parents' health, thereby identifying potential policy levers
The vast majority of scholarship on nonstandard shifts has been done in the US context, arguably a country with the most limited family and childcare policies of any industrialized country. This proposed research program will fill the gaps by focusing on the UK context to investigate the implications of parental nonstandard employment on children's and parents' health. The project will profile the characteristics of mothers and fathers who work nonstandard work schedules, and examine different markers of health and development for children, and a range of markers of health and family life for parents. Factors in the family environment will be considered to investigate the channels through which nonstandard work schedules influence children and parents. Furthermore, the statistical techniques and data source will ascertain whether nonstandard work schedules actually cause differences in health between parents who work such schedules and parents who work 9-5 schedules. This type of research will be made possible by using rich, longitudinal data in the UK: the Millennium Cohort Study. This is an ideal dataset because it contains detailed information on family circumstances, parenting, and economic resources. 
The applicant will disseminate findings to a wide range of beneficiaries. Dissemination of the research via peer-reviewed publications in high impact journals and international conferences will be key. Opportunities to disseminate work through seminars will be pursued. In addition to an academic audience, the research will benefit employers, family and employment policy makers, parents, teachers, social workers, child care providers and others who seek to contribute to the continuing policy debate on the effects of parental employment on children's and parents' health. The research will have impact via a number of mechanisms: Collaborating with policy makers, charities, and think tanks, such as National Children's Bureau, DWP, PHE, Working Families, Women's Business Council, and The Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee; Disseminate research findings and promote impact related activities through online platforms, such as WorkFlex blog at Working Families, Mumsnet, ToUChstone blog (operated by TUC), and The Conversation; Deliver evidence through podcasts and audio slide shows to forums that increase awareness of policy issues, such as The Lancet UK Policy Matters, the National Child and Maternal Health Intelligence Network, and platforms, such as Workingmums and The Work Foundation blog; share findings with campaigners, policy experts, and lobbyists through submissions to Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology, Parliamentary special advisors and research assistants.","The proposed research program, &quot;Parental Nonstandard Work Schedules in the UK: Implications for Children's and Parents' Health&quot; will be of great interest to a wide range of users spanning many sectors. The goal of this study is to successfully exchange knowledge and evidence on the influence of nonstandard shifts on children's health and development and parents' health with a wide range of individuals and groups-employers, unions, parents, schools, and policy makers. The proposed impact and communication activities will equip individuals in the UK and globally with information they need to strengthen the case for improving work conditions and for family friendly workplace reform, alongside ensuring that children and parents have optimal physical and mental health to participate fully in the workplace and society.

This work will appeal to a wide audience in the UK and internationally. Academic researchers within the broad fields of social science and population health, alongside disciplines of economics, child development, and sociology will benefit greatly from the evidence and methodological insights of the findings. Open-access peer-reviewed journal articles, conference presentations, and invited seminars will expose the research to a multidisciplinary audience of researchers who use population-level survey data. 

The project will engage voluntary, private, public and political stakeholders to increase and influence evidence based public policy making. Knowledge transfer and exchange with users will ensure co-production of research findings that are a benefit to organizations' impact on the health of the working age population, children and families, and wider society. These beneficiaries are:

-Government: Department of Health; The Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee; Public Health England; Department for Work and Pensions; Local government. The findings on the social and health consequences of nonstandard shifts could be used to promote and strengthen family policies. 
-Charities and advocacy groups: National Children's Bureau; Child Poverty Action Group; The Work Foundation; Working Families; Workingmums.co.uk; Working with Men; Family and Parenting Institute; Fatherhood Institute. Project findings will benefit these groups in their engagement with employers and parents in discussions regarding the influence of nonstandard shifts on parents, children, and family life. 
-Educators and health care professionals: Teachers; social workers; nurses; doctors; childcare providers. Individuals who are at the frontline of supporting parents, children, and families who may be affected by nonstandard hours will benefit from the project findings so that interventions and services can support working families. 
-Businesses and unions: Findings on the positive or negative effects of nonstandard shifts will be of interest to employers and union members such that workplace reforms and supportive working environments are provided to ensure the care of all workers and their families. 
-Public and media: Schools; parents; children; communities; journalists; broadcasters; editors; media outlets. High quality media coverage with trusted outlets will translate directly to bringing the findings to the attention of the general public and to individuals who want to and are engaged in the debate on supporting working families and supporting social inclusion.","Afshin Zilanawala","Demography","Medical & health interface","Sociology","Demography (General)","Med Soc/Soc Health & Illness","Mental Health","Sociology","Stratification",NA

Last year alone, 96,000 people in the UK died prematurely as a direct result of smoking and more than double this number of children took up smoking to take their place. As the 'average' smoker, smoking 12 cigarettes per day, will view their cigarette pack at least 4,300 times a year, the cigarette pack offers governments a unique tool to communicate the health impacts of smoking. The introduction of standardised (i.e., plain) packaging of cigarettes in the UK will mean that health warnings on packs are more noticeable. However, in order for this landmark legislation to be effective, these health warnings need to be sending out the right messages.

Although health warnings with strong, threatening images and messages are used on cigarette packs in over 100 countries, there is evidence that smokers may avoid them or react negatively towards them. Theory suggests that warnings are most likely to result in positive behaviour change if they combine threatening messages with those which increase a smoker's perceived ability to stop smoking and knowledge of the benefits of stopping (known as 'efficacy' messages). Despite this, there has been very little research on the impact of efficacy messages on tobacco warnings, no research on how adolescents respond to efficacy messages and almost no adoption of efficacy messages on tobacco warnings globally.

This project will address these key issues by examining responses to warnings with 'efficacy' and 'threatening' content and developing research on what constitutes effective warnings. This research is critically important given the potential for health warnings to educate individuals about the risks of smoking and encourage them to stop. It will apply a strong theoretical framework to examine the roles of efficacy and threatening content on warnings among both adults and adolescents. Given that two-thirds of smokers start before the age of 18, there is surprisingly little research on the impact of warnings among adolescents. My research will address this critical gap in the literature.

This project is timely and important, not only because of the recent introduction of standardised packaging of cigarettes. Britain's exit from the EU will provide the UK government with a unique opportunity to implement new warnings and strengthen tobacco control policies, as these will no longer be enforced by the EU-wide Tobacco Products Directive.

I will conduct online surveys among adults and adolescents smokers. These surveys will examine, for the first time, responses to threatening and efficacy warnings and their impact on attitudes towards smoking. I will then use the findings of these studies to conduct two 'mixed methods studies' among adults and adolescents to measure self-reported reactions, brain activation and smoking behaviour in response to health warnings.

My research uses a unique combination of innovative approaches combining subjective and objective techniques. This research is novel in a number of ways. First, it will provide objective and previously unexplored insights into differences in response to warnings among adults and adolescents. Second, it will develop our understanding of the mechanisms underlying responses to efficacy and threatening warnings. Finally, it will produce the first evidence demonstrating how neural and subjective responses to warnings are related and how these predict longer-term smoking behaviours and attitudes. This research will support the development of better, more effective warnings for tobacco products and provide a toolkit for the development of effective warnings for a range of unhealthy products, such as alcohol and unhealthy food, which can be used by academics and policymakers internationally. This project ultimately aims to reduce the rates of premature death and disease caused by smoking by providing evidence to support tobacco packaging policy change.","WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM THE RESEARCH? 
 
1. Public health organisations and campaigners intending to influence tobacco control policies both nationally and internationally (i.e. civil society). 
 
2. Health professionals including stop smoking advisers, doctors, nurses and other allied healthcare professionals who provide support to smokers planning to quit smoking. 
 
3. National and international policymakers making evidence-based policy decisions regarding tobacco control and in particular, tobacco labelling policies. 
 
4. The general public, including both smokers and non-smokers, in particular young people susceptible to starting to smoke. 
 
HOW WILL THEY BENEFIT FROM THIS RESEARCH? 
 
1. Public health organisations and campaigners 
 
The research I conduct will provide public health organisations and campaigners with an empirical evidence base which can be used to design effective tobacco health warning labels. This will be used to enact change at national and international policy levels, improving the efficacy of tobacco health warning labels, ultimately reducing the burden of morbidity and mortality caused by smoking. 
 
I have already established an important route for knowledge exchange with public health organisations by discussing my research plans with Anca Toma Friedlaender, Director of Communications and International Policy at the Smoke Free Partnership. This organisation promotes tobacco control advocacy and policy research at EU and national levels. My research plans have been informed by these discussions, to ensure that the research I conduct will be of use to this influential advocacy organisation. My research will provide cutting-edge empirically supported evidence to inform their discussions with policymakers regarding tobacco control policy. 
 
More broadly, my research will provide a framework for the framing for other smoking cessation interventions, including mass media campaigns and advice given to patients (i.e., the degree of inclusion of efficacy and threatening information). 
 
2. Health professionals 
 
Stop smoking advisers, doctors, nurses and other allied healthcare professionals rely on evidence to inform their practice and treatment of smokers. As described above, the research I conduct will inform guidance on how smoking cessation messages should be framed in order to encourage healthy behaviour change. 
 
3. National and international policymakers 
 
This research will help develop an evidence base that policymakers nationally and internationally can draw on to inform best practice tobacco control policy. My previous research in this field has been cited in policy documents in the UK and in the Australian High Court to support their decision to introduce standardised packaging of cigarettes. The European Commission's Tobacco Products Directive (TPD), a policy document which dictates EU tobacco policy for approximately the next 12 years also cites my research. 
 
My research will also be of particular interest to policymakers in any country wishing to strengthen their tobacco health warning labels, in particular the USA, which is yet to introduce pictorial health warnings on tobacco products and which has received considerable opposition to this policy by the tobacco industry which has argued that proposed pictorial warnings are not 'factual and uncontroversial'. My research will provide evidence to support the development of such warnings. 
 
4. The general public 
 
The research I conduct on the optimal framing of tobacco health warning labels can be used by the general public when encouraging friends and loved ones to stop smoking. More broadly, through the other beneficiaries of this research, the general public will benefit through improved tobacco health warnings both in the UK and internationally which will ultimately improve population health and wellbeing through increased smoking cessation and prevention of smoking uptake.","Olivia Maynard","Psychology","Social Policy","Health Psychology","Social Policy",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

There is evidence that experiencing threat or danger causes attention to become hyper-focused, and that the presence of an external threat such as a spider or snake causes a rapid spatial bias towards the source of this threat. However, highly selective attention requires active top-down control mechanisms that guide attention to particular objects and locations. The claim that threat causes our attention to become highly selective is inconsistent with evidence showing that negative emotions of threat, fear, and stress cause impairments in cognitive control, resulting in poor concentration and high distractibility in everyday life. If threat impairs this cognitive control, how can it also result in better control over attentional selectivity? The proposed research aims to resolve this conflict and provide an overarching theory of how threat, both experienced internally as an emotion and externally when seeing threatening objects, impacts our basic perception, attention, and cognitive control. 

The current project is based on a new unified vigilance theory, which claims that when we experience feelings of threat or danger, our mental processes adapt in a number of key ways. Firstly, because we feel in danger, we attempt to maximize our visual processing to try to detect an external threat or aggressor. Typically, our visual world contains many task-irrelevant objects (e.g., looking at a stop sign while driving, while trying to ignore the birds, the helicopter overhead, the billboards, etc) that have to be ignored (&quot;filtered out&quot;) so that only the information that is currently relevant is prioritized. When experiencing threat or danger, our incentives change towards processing as much as information as possible in order to detect any potential threat that may occur. As a result, our perceptual sensitivity is increased, so that more information is processed in better detail than usually. Furthermore, cognitive control is suppressed, thus inhibiting filtering mechanisms that typically act to prevent irrelevant information from being processed. As a result, our sensitivity improves - we are better able to process more information but, at the same time, we are much more prone to the negative effects of distraction by irrelevant information. This highlights the role of threat in cognition: our response to threat is adaptive when the likelihood of an external danger is real. However, when our feelings of threat and fear are not warranted, our response is maladaptive, resulting in an inability to concentrate and ignore distractions effectively. 

I aim to establish this theory of threat by manipulating internal and external emotion in studies examining perceptual and attentional abilities. Participants will be primed to experience acute feelings of threat, such as completing a task where they occasionally receive a mild electric shock or loud noise presented over headphones. Their ability to process multiple objects, and their ability to ignore salient distractions will be assessed, both in general situations with non-threatening objects and in situations where some objects are emotional (e.g., angry faces). This work will elucidate how threat impacts our daily activities, and both its positive and negative consequences, depending on context. Finally, a key aim of this research is to show how these basic mechanisms can help us understand the difficulties and symptoms experienced by individuals characterized by high levels of perceived threat and anxiety (e.g., anxiety disorders or general high anxious personality). Understanding how threat affects our perception, attention, and cognitive control can inform improved therapeutic interventions designed to treat individuals whose high levels of fear and anxiety have led to ingrained maladaptive responses that impair their daily life.","The proposed research primarily involves basic psychological and neuroscientific research into how the experience of threat (both internally and externally) influences our perceptual and attentional abilities in relation to top-down cognitive control. Thus, as outlined within the academic beneficiaries section, primary beneficiaries are psychologists, cognitive neuroscientists, and neuroscientists with interests in the areas of visual perception, selective attention, cognitive control, emotion-cognition interactions, as well as individual differences in affective traits on these processes. These individuals will benefit from contribution to the understanding of these research domains (see Academic Beneficiaries section). 

The research also has practical implications to many areas. Firstly, evidence of how the experience of threat influences psychological function is of high relevance to clinicians working with individuals suffering from affective disorders such as generalised anxiety disorder or phobias. Such benefits include the development of therapeutic interventions that take into account evidence of how threat influences visual processing and attention, which directly relate to hallmark symptoms of anxiety disorders (e.g., attentional biases to threat). Treatment strategies involving directly targeting aspects of attention in anxious individuals, such as spatial focus or improving attentional selectivity in relation to cognitive control training, would be two examples of how these individuals could benefit from the proposed research. In addition, the proposed work would also have practical implications to other stakeholders, from understanding how threat and fear can influence novice learner drivers' attention and distractibility, to soldiers requiring focused attention or efficient visual detection skills in high stress war-zone situations, sportsmen interested in combating anxiety's influence to distraction in competitive scenarios, and to advertisers and marketers interested in how emotional states or the presentation of emotion-laden stimuli can influence where individuals look and what information they have difficulty ignoring. Please see the &quot;pathways to impact&quot; document for details on how these potential stakeholders will be reached.","Nick Berggren","Psychology","Cognitive Psychology","Experimental Psychology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

For the last three years, 'lad cultures' and associated reports of inappropriate sexual harassment, violence and trans/homophobia in universities, have been the focus of much debate for the UK media, educational leaders and Government policy makers. There is now a considerable body of research documenting 'lad cultures' in universities. Existing research has led to better awareness of the need in universities to have policies, training and communications campaigns to emphasise appropriate forms of masculinity and to police inappropriate behaviours where necessary. Concerns have also been raised about inappropriate behaviours from young men on SNS through 'lad culture' related hashtags, with increasing reports of misogynistic trolling against women and homo/transphobic abuse. Against the backdrop of these concerns, this research will contribute additional data from, and about, SNS sources, so as to develop a wider understanding of the role of SNS in 'lad cultures' as part of contemporary young masculinities in the UK, and help facilitate discussion and training about appropriate masculinities on SNS. 

The research adds to our understanding of 'lad cultures' by exploring how behaviours associated to 'laddism', are represented, consumed and (re)produced as part of young masculinities on the SNS platforms of Twitter and Instagram. It examines these platforms through discourse analysis of interactions in popular 'lad' related hashtags, to create a picture of how the elements of 'lad culture' which cause concern, fit with other modes of SNS expression related to 'laddism', such as 'banter', humour and sport. The research goes beyond the simplistic and often polarised descriptions of young masculinities in 'lad cultures' given in media reports, to develop a nuanced picture of the associations made to 'lad culture'. Through qualitative research (focus groups and interviews) amongst SNS users, it will seek to understand how they experience posts and images related to 'lad culture'. Many university based 'lad cultures' are made up of predominantly middle and elite class white men. However, when we trace 'lad culture' in the UK historically, to the 'new lad' made famous by Loaded magazine in the 1990s, and anxieties about 'laddism' in schools in the 1970s, 'lad culture' hailed from the working classes. The media is still replete with representations of working class 'lads' from Youtube's Dapper Laughs, giving fellow lads tips on how to 'pull', through to the continual objectification of women expressed by Gaz Beadle and Scott Timlin from MTV's Geordie Shore (2011-2016). The research therefore also considers if class differences create different or similar discourses, visual formations and experiences of 'lad cultures' on SNS. To facilitate debate about what is appropriate masculinity in the particular context of SNS, and to create meaningful and appropriate impact from those discussions, the research will be conducted in conjunction with three community based charity project partners, each with an interest in a key strand of the research in terms of their own strategy, policy and training plans: Goodlad Initiative, promoting and training around positive and appropriate masculinity; Survivors Network, helping those who have experienced sexual abuse and violence; and METRO, tackling homo/transphobia and offering support around gender and sexual identity. The charities will offer expertise, links to young people, and will work with the project to develop training around appropriate and positive masculinities for their users, staff and other community groups. The research will yield a vital data set for academics, policymakers, Government, universities and the media.","The research project is designed to have considerable impact upon stakeholders, and those who are the subject of the research, above and beyond immediate academic beneficiaries, as follows: GoodLad Initiative (GL) will develop their strategy, policies and specific sections of their workshops that focus upon appropriate and positive masculinity in social networking sites using the new research. GL will specifically benefit from understanding young people's views on 'lad cultures' on SNS including particular scenarios experienced by all genders and sexual orientations that could be used as anonymised role plays or discussion points. Thus, users of GL will experience the impact of new insights into the way 'lad cultures' are viewed on SNS and will be able to reflect on their proximity to or distance from these situations. 

Survivors Network (SN) propose to use the research to inform their strategy and policies around experiences of 'lad cultures', harassment, bullying online, physical sexual harassment and violence to plan its approaches, information provision and appropriate training for its staff Thus, SN can understand the specific issues on SNS and consider how people from all genders take part in a 'lad culture' that can lead to sexual harassment and violence. Ultimately it will be those seeking advice from SN about online and offline harassment who will be impacted by the outcomes of the research, via the interventions of SN as an intermediary. METRO is an equalities charity promoting diversity and wellbeing through youth, mental health and wellbeing services. METRO aim to better understand issues that can affect wellbeing in relation to gender and sexual identity to inform their own strategy and provision of services in the area. METRO will benefit from understanding issues of inclusion and exclusion for LGBTQI+ people in relation to 'lad cultures'. Thus, its users will benefit and be impacted by provision of information and training about changing masculinities in the UK and how to negotiate discourses of masculinity in relation to their own gender and sexual identity. 

Beyond these immediate project partners, wider impact is envisaged, which will implicate the broadcast and print news media, SNS companies (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, Google, LADbible), Government policy makers, professionals working with young people, sports and community groups working with young adults through the availability of new knowledge about the nature of 'lad cultures'. The project will provide a broader and more nuanced view of how 'lad cultures' are reproduced and the types of discourses that dominate conversations, from those that have been associated with sexual harassment and homo/transphobia, to other versions of the 'lad' associated to sports, friendship and leisure. Representatives of these groups, will each be advantaged by direct dissemination of the results through the following means: 

1) All project partners will receive copies of the research and work in conjunction with the research team to produce training materials for their own use. 
2) These materials will also be more broadly disseminated through website availability, project partner and university networks, and SNS shares. 
3) Briefing papers targeting relevant Government committees, businesses, sports associations and teams, the NUS, universities and other relevant community groups will be produced. These will include visuals of 'lad culture' conversations to make the research accessible to the media and wider non-academic organisations (see 'Pathways to Impact' document). 
4) Project partners, university welfare leaders, policy makers and the media will be invited to a launch of the report at a 'Young Masculinities and Social Networking Sites' conference. 
5) The project and its results will be promoted through SNS and to the media through posts and press releases. 
6) All data will be stored by the UK Data service on behalf of the ESRC for public access.","Alison Phipps","Media","Sociology","Cultural Studies","New Media/Web-Based Studies","Womens and Gender Studies",NA,NA,NA,NA

Research to date suggests that such adversities can have long-term effects on health. For instance, adversities experienced in childhood and even during pregnancy may alter the way the body deals with stress throughout life. This can result in an increased risk of diseases such as heart disease, depression and type 2 diabetes. It is therefore important to investigate how early life adversities might be linked to poorer health to better inform the development of interventions. 

Previous research into the health effects of early life adversities has been limited in a number of ways. Firstly, many studies have added up the number of adversities a child has experienced to create a score indicating 'total stress'. Unfortunately many children who experience one adversity are also more likely to experience another. The approach of tallying adversities does not help us to understand how adversities might affect health and what we can do about this. We also don't know whether experiencing adversities at certain ages (e.g. during pregnancy) has a greater effect on health than when experienced at other points in early life. There is also little evidence on whether associations between early life adversities and health are different for boys and girls. Also different types of early life adversity are likely to have different associations with health.

The aim of this project is to develop a more valid measure of early life adversity and investigate how it is related to health at different points of life. This new measure will take account of the way in which children who experience one adversity are more likely to experience another. This measure will then be applied to look at associations with health. The research will focus on mental health from childhood onwards, as well as biological markers of stress from childhood and into adulthood. 

The research will use three of the UK's world-renowned longitudinal studies: the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS), Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), and National Child Development Study (NCDS). These are all large studies with &gt;15,000 participants. Each study has followed the same group of people over time. ALSPAC will be used to assess associations between early life adversities in relation to biological markers of stress from childhood into adolescence. The MCS will be used to assess whether children who experience early life adversities are more likely to have mental health problems across childhood and into adolescence. Finally, the NCDS will be used to test associations between early life adversities and both biological markers of stress in middle-age and mental health across adulthood.

The proposed project will be undertaken at the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health at UCL under the mentorship of Prof. Yvonne Kelly, with support from a network of experts in social statistics, biology and sociology in the International Centre for Life Course Studies in Society and Health. Non-academic partners will be involved from the beginning of the research process. These partners include Barnardo's, the Association of Young People's Health and the Department of Health, who will be able to feed the findings of the research into their work with vulnerable families. Outputs from the project will include at least six academic papers, presentations at six conferences, a briefing note for non-academic audiences, an end of project policy seminar for academics and non-academics, and contributions to blogs and Twitter. The project also has a strong training element to enable the principal investigator to make the transition to independent researcher.

In summary, this project has the potential to advance research in the field of early life adversities and health. It will be the first to provide evidence on how early life adversities increase the risk of poor health.","This important research project has the potential to benefit a wide range of key stakeholders, including policy makers, public organisations, the general public and the charitable sector. 

1. Policymakers
The analyses on the clustering of early life adversities will represent the first step in being able to investigate life course pathways linking adversities to health. This will be done using high quality UK longitudinal data and appropriate analytical methods which have the potential to greatly advance the existing evidence base. This research will equip policymakers with good quality evidence to inform future interventions and policy development in order to prevent later health problems and subsequent costs to society, both financial and non-financial. The Department of Health will be particularly relevant to this project. Dr Ray Earwicker, Lead for Troubled Families, Homelessness and Wider Health Inequalities, will be involved as a non-academic partner from the beginning of the project. His input will be valuable to ensure the research is as policy relevant as possible and he will be able to feed the project outputs to his departmental colleagues. 

2. Public organisations
It will also be important to engage with other public organisations, such as Public Health England (PHE), to further disseminate the research. PHE's remit is to reduce health inequalities and improve the nation's health and wellbeing, therefore the research is likely to be highly relevant for their work. The office of the Children's Commissioner would also be interested in this project. Their role is to promote children's rights in England, particularly those of the most vulnerable children. This research will provide further evidence for their work, particularly promoting childhood has a priority policy area.

3. General public
This research will be of significance to the general public, particularly children at risk of, or who have experienced, adversities. In particular, the research will show how early life adversity can have lifelong health impacts. The investigation of clustering of adversities will enable the basis for investigating mechanisms linking adversities to health, therefore providing information and opportunities to target interventions. This has the potential to alleviate the long-term health consequences of early life adversity at the population level.

4. Charitable sector
Charities, particularly those who work with vulnerable families, will benefit from this research. This research will provide good quality evidence to strengthen their missions to support the UK's most at risk families. To ensure that this is done successfully, two such charities (Barnardo's and the Association for Young People's Health) will be involved in this research from the outset in the form of a project advisory group. This will ensure that the research is of practical use to these organisations and they will be able to provide valuable input and feedback to this work throughout. The Association for Young People's Health champions the health and wellbeing of UK adolescents, and promotes evidence-based practice. Barnardo's offers family support and counselling services, and lobbies the government on issues affecting vulnerable families, therefore the findings of this project have the potential to feed into these activities and to the activities of similar organisations.

This exciting interdisciplinary project therefore has a wide range of beneficiaries who will be engaged with throughout the project. The ultimate impact aim of this project is to improve the health of people experiencing early life adversities. The involvement of the stakeholders above is key to ensuring the greatest possible impact of this project in attempting to reach this aim. Further information on how these stakeholders will be reached is included in the Pathways to Impact.","Rebecca Lacey","Medical & health interface","Psychology","Social Work","Sociology","Children and Families","Developmental psychology","Med Soc/Soc Health & Illness","Medical science & disease",NA

At school, adjectives are explicitly taught as a way for children to develop their narrative abilities and language complexity. Adjectives are essential for describing and differentiating. They can increase vocabulary, which is highly predictive of children's subsequent achievement, i.e. children who arrive at school with good language skills have better chances at school, better chances of entering higher education, and better economic skills in adulthood (Blanden, 2006). 

However, children are unable to use adjectives flexibly until around four years of age, a late stage compared to the acquisition of other open word classes. Despite their clear importance and relatively late appearance, adjectives have received little attention by researchers. Crucially, adjectives may present particular challenges to children with or at risk of language delay (Ricks &amp; Alt, 2016), yet speech and language therapy has not typically focused on this aspect of language. 

This project will transform our understanding of how young children experience adjectives and how they use that input in their own developing speech. By examining children's psycholinguistic processing within its social context, we will reveal how socioeconomic background affects developmental mechanisms, integrating research strands previously kept separate. An integrated approach is vital for fully understanding the challenges children face when acquiring adjectives. Our findings will enable us to identify the very best ways of boosting children's language at home and at school, across the socioeconomic spectrum. In a series of experiments, I will survey the descriptive language that children hear, measure 3-year-olds' comprehension of a range of adjectives using state of the art eyetracking methods, develop an innovative method which enables laboratory-grade measurement of children's language processing in response to their caregivers' naturalistic speech, and evaluate the effectiveness of a randomised controlled family-based language intervention. With community groups, practitioners, and national organisations, I will use the findings to co-produce accessible materials for promoting language in children from a range of backgrounds. 

Children's language experience and skills vary widely as a function of their socioeconomic background. Children from the lowest UK income quintile can be up to 19 months behind their more affluent peers in vocabulary development on school entry (Sutton Trust, 2012), and the increased risk of early language problems for children growing up in socioeconomically disadvantaged families has been well documented. Although the impact of socioeconomic factors on other aspects of language development is clear, their effect on adjective acquisition has not yet been explored. Some of the challenges posed by adjectives may be disproportionate for children from low socioeconomic backgrounds, whose word learning and sentence comprehension difficulties are more likely to hinder their ability to handle descriptive language. More positively, research suggests that the language that caregivers use with their children can help: the more adjectives they use, and the more explicitly they use them in sentences, the more effective their children's use of adjectives will be. 

Findings will have important theoretical and methodological implications for research in language development. They will also have significant societal impact. With an expert advisory board, I will use my research findings to co-produce targeted recommendations to families, practitioners, and policymakers working with children facing challenges with descriptive language. The project also offers numerous opportunities for my development as a leading international researcher in language acquisition, and for the project team in their career development.","The project will provide:
-Empirical evidence about how the language that children hear affects their own language abilities
-Evidence-based advice about how to design language-boosting interventions for young children across socioeconomic groups 

Moving from local through to national impact with the project's lifespan, outcomes will benefit:
1. Children and parents/carers. Parents play a central role in children's language development, but may not know the best way of interacting directly with their children to intensify opportunities for speaking and listening (Bercow, 2008). Similarly, the extent to which early language influences children's later development is not widely known. Both these messages will be communicated to families via their visits to the Child Development Unit, via post-study updates, and a report containing easy-to-follow guidance about language-boosting activities.
2. Practitioners in early years education, e.g. Early Years Foundation Stage staff; Children's Centres. The UK government recognises the value of high quality early education, yet providing language-rich environments in early years settings can be challenging. We will provide clear advice about how to enrich the language that children hear, and how to engage parents to maximise language-building opportunities. We will also offer practical support to staff and parents by delivering tailored sessions about language development and school readiness. With the National College for Teaching &amp; Leadership, we will discuss how the workshops could be embedded in the curriculum for nursery professional qualifications. This will be foundational for improved oral language development in initial teacher training, as recommended in the Nov 2016 meeting of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Speech and Language Difficulties.
3. Practitioners in healthcare, e.g. health visitors, family outreach workers, speech and language therapists. Language interventions have the potential to boost language in children at risk of language delay (i.e. those low on the socioeconomic spectrum or those diagnosed with speech, language and communication needs). However, the most effective way of using them across different groups is not yet clear. Together with clinical members of the advisory board, we will co-produce a report detailing best practice in this area. A co-authored practitioner review article will also be published, providing details of the experimental findings and how they apply to practice.
4. Local groups specialising in play-based communication. Grassroots groups can offer creative approaches to implementing research findings, maximising engagement in end users. However, they typically lack the networks required to connect with research. Throughout the lifecycle of the project, we will explore mutual benefits of our work with these groups.
5. Third sector groups promoting language and literacy. We will provide data about the effect of shared reading or other forms of language play on language development. This will inform the work of national organisations such as The Communication Trust, whose 400 Communication Ambassadors work with 8,000 families in disadvantaged areas of England, sharing information about how families can best help their children's language.
6. Policymakers seeking to improve the life chances of UK children (e.g. Local Authorities, local commissioners of health services, All-Party Parliamentary Groups and secretariats, the Education Select Committee). The preschool years are recognised as being crucial in determining later life chances, with early interventions yielding savings to the UK's economy (Grint &amp; Holt, 2011). Starting with The Communication Trust's What Works database, we will submit recommendations from WP3 to the evidence base of interventions supporting children's communication.
7. Members of the public will benefit from a better understanding of language development via public engagement events.","Catherine Davies","Education","Linguistics","Psychology","Developmental psychology","Language Acquisition","Psycholinguistics","Psychology of Education","Semantics & Pragmatics",NA

It was first articulated by ICISS in its 2001 report. It was adopted by states at the 2005 World Summit and it has been developed by the UN Secretary General in annual reports beginning in 2009. It informed the state response to the Libya crisis of 2011. The value and relevance of the norm has been challenged by international society's failure to establish peace and security in Libya following the 2011 intervention, as well as the failure to prevent atrocity crimes since then, most notably in Syria.
 
In many respects, the UN Security Council's failure in protecting Syria's population can be linked to international society's post-war failures in Libya. For instance, the failure to adequately plan for the post-Gaddafi situation and the failure to commit to a rebuilding programme, contributed to a vacuum that was occupied by political extremists and terrorists. This tainted western leadership, divided the Security Council and contributed to international society's failure to protect the Syrian population.

This critique of western intervention in Libya demonstrates the existence, at least at a discursive level, of a responsibility to rebuild (R2R). R2R is, however, only implicit in the discourse. Indeed attempts by norm entrepreneurs like ICISS to make R2R explicit by identifying it as a requirement of R2P have been rejected by international society. Where the ICISS report understood R2P in terms of three responsibilities - prevention, reaction and rebuilding -, the rebuilding element disappeared from the World Summit Outcome Document (WSOD). This has influenced the direction of R2P scholarship too. Academic work on R2P has been dominated by analysis of the responsibilities to prevent and react. R2R is very much under-researched. Given the how the failures to rebuild have impacted on the support for R2P and for humanitarian intervention more generally, this oversight is not without consequence. 

The aim here to address this gap in our knowledge of R2R. The research will explain why R2R has been marginalised in policy and academic discourse on R2P. It will help us understand the normative and practical implications of that process. The research will involve process and discourse tracing to explain R2R's normative significance. Furthermore, it will analyse those processes against the backdrop of norm-life cycle theory and in a political context where the establishment of a new norm (R2P) necessitated compromises. Finally, it will consider the appropriateness of those compromises. 

To the extent R2P was adopted by states, one might conclude that the rhetorical marginalisation of R2R was appropriate. However, to the extent R2P interventions like Libya have been judged a failure because they failed to properly prepare for the post-war phase, one might counter-argue that the marginalisation of R2R is unwarranted and inappropriate.

In this way, the research will contribute to theories of norm development, as well as to normative arguments that enable the assessment of state practice and foreign policy recommendations.","While western governments celebrated the overthrow of the Gaddafi regime, they failed to adequately prepare for the post-intervention phase of their involvement. Libya's descent into civil war challenges the narrative of a successful intervention. The outgoing US President Barack Obama for example openly criticised the failure of the key architects of the Libyan intervention, the UK and France, to follow through on their responsibilities (the Atlantic, April 2016). The UK Foreign Affairs Committee (FAC) echoed Obama's criticism, concluding that 'UK policy in Libya before and since the intervention of March 2011 was founded on erroneous assumptions and an incomplete understanding of the country and the situation'. Extending this reasoning, this criticism reflects badly on the R2P norm to the extent it legitimised an intervention by states who seemingly failed to take the responsibility to rebuild seriously. More to the point, the criticism demonstrates the political significance of this research question and the interest policymakers and UK politicians have in understanding the place R2R has in R2P and broader UK strategy. 
 
Different pathways to impact have been identified to ensure that the research from the project informs policy-making. Two different aspects of the policy community will be targeted: policymakers and advocacy groups. Both these groups will be invited to join academics at a workshop on the University of Leeds campus, where the findings of project will be discussed and further pathways to impact developed, including the publication and dissemination of a policy brief. This is addition to a PhD student conference that will deepen these existing networks and encourage a sustainable research agenda in this area. 
 
In terms of the UK policy-making community, I will submit evidence to relevant FAC inquiries, attend the Parliamentary Outreach Service's networking events to raise my profile as a scholar and build contacts with the members of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on the United Nations (focusing on the prevention and resolution of deadly conflicts) by attending the group's activities. This strategy will draw on the experience of researchers at the University of Leeds, including Professor Ralph (whose research was cited in the 2014 FAC report on US-UK relations) and Dr. Gallagher (whose research was cited in 2016 report on the Libya intervention). To reach wider, European policy audiences, I will build on ECR2P's links with the EU External Action Service and respond to consultations. I will build links with the EU-CIVCAP expert network that contributes to the EU Commission's policy-making work by producing analysis and evaluation of the EU's peacebuilding and conflict prevention activities. As an EU-funded project, EU-CIVCAP provides a good opportunity to influence EU policy. 

In addition to benefiting policy-makers, the research can also inform the work of various R2P advocacy groups. The main research users in this regard are organisations such as the Global Centre for R2P, a US-based advocacy group that has briefed the UN General Assembly on the issue and the International Coalition for the Responsibility to Protect, an INGO-based organisation seeking to promote the R2P norm. Working under the umbrella of the European Centre for R2P at the University of Leeds facilitates access to these and its other partner institutions, including the Asia-Pacific Centre for the Responsibility to Protect (University of Queensland) the Budapest Centre for the Prevention of Mass Atrocity, The Hague Institute for Global Justice, and the London-based advocacy group Protection Approaches. 

Successful realization of the above impact strategies is manifested in invitations to speak at events organised by government department or non-governmental organisations, to give advice to policy-makers and civil servants and in references to my research in policy briefs or other documents issued.","Outi Donovan","Pol. sci. & internat. studies","Conflict/War Studies","International Law","Peace Studies",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Research has widely demonstrated the impact that stress at work can have on individual health. For example work stress is related to heart disease, poorer immune system functioning and increased likelihood of developing symptoms of depression. It is the number one cause of long term sickness absence (greater than four weeks), and number two cause of short-term sickness absence, in the UK. Stress not only impacts the individual but also the organisation that they work for. For example, for every individual employed in the UK an average of 7.5 days are lost due to stress sickness absence, with that number increasing to nearly 11 days in the healthcare sector. Indeed, on average, NHS employees take more than 15 days off per year due to stress - twice the national average - with stress sickness absence levels increasing by 37% over the past 3 years. Tackling stress in the NHS is therefore such an important task that it has recently become linked to amounts of funding NHS Trusts receive each year.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES
The main aim of this project is to design a series of stress management interventions to reduce sickness absence in three large NHS Trusts. The interventions will be co-designed with employees using a Participatory Action Research methodology. Through a series of individual interviews, focus groups, and meetings with dedicated wellbeing groups across three participating NHS Trusts, we will design interventions and a wellbeing toolkit for the improvement of stress awareness and communication which will be presented through a smartphone app. An app has been chosen for its ability to be easily accessed and distributed across a wide range and large number of individuals, and because it means information can be disseminated quickly to a wide range of NHS employees.

The first of three research objectives is to co-design (alongside NHS employees), distribute, and evaluate a wellbeing toolkit for NHS staff. The toolkit will provide understanding of how to spot and what to do about the signs of work stress in self and others. The second objective is to co-design NHS-specific interventions for the improvement of working conditions. These everyday stressors significantly contribute to the experience of work stress, and thus interventions which are aimed at these stressors are highly sought after. We will therefore co-design, implement and evaluate interventions delivered by the smartphone app for the improvement of these everyday stressors. Finally, NHS organisations consist of an administrative 'hub' organisation which service numerous satellite sites (i.e. hospitals, care centres). This leads to issues with communication of wellbeing initiatives being adequately communicated across the whole organisation. This project will therefore help to disseminate this information widely across participating organisations via the smartphone application, and thus determine best practice to ensure this reach is substantial.

APPLICATIONS: THE NHS AND BEYOND
There are clear applications for this project, from an individual employee to a wider NHS organisational perspective. Fewer individuals will be affected by stress at work, meaning that individual health will be improved in the short-to-medium term. Organisationally we aim for there to be fewer days lost due to work stress, meaning improved productivity over the short term and reduced sickness absence costs over the long term. Moving beyond the presented project, we will look to expand to a wider proportion of the NHS and other healthcare organisations. The project will also improve public knowledge of the effects of stress at work through public engagement events such as media appearances and dissemination, organisational and policy-maker understanding through an NHS staff wellbeing conference, and academic understanding via a wide range of journal and conference publications","The NHS employs the largest number of public sector workers in the UK, accounting for nearly 30% of all public-sector employment. We seek to work with employees within three large NHS Trusts in England (c.2000 employees) to develop a new stress awareness and management intervention which is tailorable for all employees in the organisations. The project will, therefore, benefit users by improving mental health and quality of life. Participating organisations will benefit from improved productivity and reduced sickness absence, and thus there is potential for this to lead to improved healthcare provided for NHS users. There will be an important knowledge sharing element to the project as it brings together academics and users of the research to make decisions and evaluate outcomes. 

In order to widen the impact of the study beyond the three participating NHS Trusts, we will hold an NHS employer's conference at which the approach taken and findings of this project will be discussed. Senior NHS England management, and those responsible for NHS employee wellbeing, will attend and contribute to the conference and thus have the ability to interact with and find out about the outcomes of this research. We will therefore have influence on policy at the local NHS Trust level, as well as wider NHS management. The project has been discussed with Laura Wilkes, head of the NHS England Healthy Workforce Programme. Wilkes has confirmed the NHS's interest in the project and potential wider take up across the NHS (see attached). Wilkes will also be invited to contribute to the NHS employers conference on staff wellbeing at the end of the project.","Andrew McVicar","Psychology","Health Psychology","Industrial-Org/Occupational","Psychology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It is both a response to, and a determinant of wage rates, it acts as a vector of disease and it shapes our sense of place. Yet a paucity of data has meant that a comprehensive analysis of internal migration in nineteenth-century England and Wales has not been possible. The recent release of the Integrated Census Microdata (I-CeM) database - containing approximately 160 million individual-level returns - means that the given place of birth of the entire population as reported in the 1851-1911 censuses of England and Wales can be used to map millions of lifetime migration paths. By analysing the changing relationship between migration, wages, the transport network and the socio-economic context, it will be possible to understand both the determinants of migration and the effect it had on the communities migrants exited and entered over a sixty year period.

The period 1851-1911 was also one in which migration fundamentally changed the profile of the British population. 1851 was the first year in which more than half the population of England and Wales were recorded as urban (50.4%) and just sixty years later, this had risen to 78.9%, almost trebling the urban population from 10.6 million to 28.2 million. Therefore, this study will provide deeper insights into the mechanisms driving individuals' migration choices which manifested themselves in the form of rapid urbanisation. It will address such questions as; if migrants were responsive to wage differentials, why did rural-urban migration peak when agricultural wages were high? What impact did the growing railway network have on migration flows? Did migration tend to occur within clearly defined boundaries? What does this tell us about individuals' sense of place?

This study will be conducted in two strands and the first will consider individuals' incentives to migrate and wage differentials - to be transcribed from Board of Trade wage surveys - while the second will analyse migrants' capacity to move. In addition to analysing the effect of straight-line distance on migration flows over time and space, the transport network as it existed in 1831 and 1911 will be analysed thanks to a collaboration with my proposed mentor Dr Leigh Shaw-Taylor and his project 'Transport, Urbanization and Economic Development in England and Wales c. 1670-1911'.

Analysing individuals' incentives to migrate in the context of factors limiting their capacity to do so allows radically new questions to be asked. Was time a more significant determinant of migrants' destination than distance once wage differentials are accounted for? Did this change as the network evolved? In order to account for migrants' constrained choice of destination, an algorithm developed with colleagues at MIT as part of my PhD will be used to identify migration fields - regions in which the number of moves within them was maximised and the number of moves between them was minimised. How did these regions shape individuals' choice of destination? By analysing the relationship between migrants' assessment of the risks and returns of leaving their parish of birth in the context of competing alternatives, the mechanisms which led to urbanisation and rural depopulation can be better understood and serve as a benchmark for further analyses of urbanisation in both the past and present.

The outputs will be delivered by depositing the enriched sources with the UK Data Archive and by journal articles, a monograph, academic presentations, workshops for potential users and a small conference, publicising the project and encouraging new analyses. Outside academia online resources will be developed for schools, family/amateur historians and the public. These online tools will facilitate studies of migration which fulfills national curriculum requirements for projects in local history and geography in Key Stages 2-4.","The main beneficiaries of this research will be all those seeking to understand the determinants of human mobility and place it into a local, national, or international context in both the past and present. Specifically, this project targets four groups of non-academic users.

1. Schools
A website will be produced to enable a range of academic and non-academic users to engage with this project and analyse the migration process. As part of the National Curriculum requirement that students between Key Stages 2-4 conduct projects in local history and geography, a teachers' pack will be produced to enable students to analyse and understand nineteenth-century migration and urbanisation in a local context. So I can produce high-quality teaching resources that will meet teachers' needs, I will engage with school teachers - supported by Schools Liaison Officer Ms Sophy Arulanantham - to gain critical feedback and input on the resources produced. Ms Arulanantham is currently working on a number of other public engagement/impact projects and her post is funded from other budgets. These teaching packs will include a range of resources that will facilitate students' independent research using the website - which will serve as the public face of this project - and the portal through which the public can access the data. The quantitative analyses will fulfill the National Curriculum requirement that all subjects support literacy and numeracy skills.

2. Family/Amateur Historians
Two workshops for potential user groups will be organised in the first and second years of the project to link together academic and non-academic users to discuss research agendas, areas of common ground in order to inform the design of the website and make it as useful and as relevant as possible to a wide audience. The website will be both simple enough for those without specialist knowledge to explore the data and sophisticated enough to allow both genealogists and professional historians to conduct more complex analyses.

3. National Policy Advisers
The relationship between migration, place and transport infrastructure remains relevant to current policy. Firstly, using an algorithm developed with colleagues at MIT to identify migration fields - the areas which individuals tended to migrate within - this project will analyse migration as a measure of community cohesion and the extent to which these regions remained stable over time. By analysing the determinants of migration and how they changed communities, this research will be relevant to agencies such as the Boundary Commission that need to produce administrative units which reflect communities. Secondly, the period 1851-1911 was not only characterised by rapid population growth and urbanisation but also by the expansion of the railway network. The relationship between these two phenomena will be analysed and compared with the effects of current projects such as HS2. Did a growing transport infrastructure generate new migration flows or simply facilitate existing ones? Did the railways break down regional cultures or reinforce them? These outputs will be published as short policy papers in 'History and Policy' - http://www.historyandpolicy.org and in the Journal of Parliamentary Affairs.

4. International Policy Advisers
With rapid urbanisation in many developing countries and the advent of a 2007 UN report estimating that over half of the world's population are now urban, this project will be relevant to policymakers interested in identifying the mechanisms driving major migration flows. How might new transport links facilitate migration? How do wage rates respond? Asking such questions of nineteenth-century England and Wales offers a model with which current migration flows can be compared and predicted as well as offer further insights into the determinants of historic and contemporary migration. These comparisons will also be disseminated through short policy-oriented papers.","Joseph Day","Demography","Economics","History","Human Geography","Cartography and GIS","Demography (General)","Demography/Pop Geography","Economic & Social History","Labour economics"

It will collaborate with young people, youth workers, managers, funders and policy makers/influencers, to understand the effects of impact measurement, and develop approaches to evaluation that are congruent with youth work practice.

Youth work can be life-changing for marginalised young people, developing social and cultural opportunities and contributing to wider community benefits. It takes place in youth clubs, community buildings and on the streets, and is open to all, or aimed at groups with shared experiences of oppression (e.g. young women, LGBT young people, young refugees). It is rooted in the 'voluntary principle' (i.e. that it is young people's choice to take part), enabling a more equal power dynamic than that in schools and formal social services. 

In recent years, spending reductions have led to the closure of many local government youth services and charitable projects. In this context, a 2011 House of Commons Education Select Committee inquiry asked youth organisations in England to demonstrate the value of their work by developing clearer outcomes measures. In response, a new youth impact agenda has emerged, instigated by government and influential third sector organisations, to promote the measurement of impact in youth settings. 

While the youth impact agenda has been welcomed by many youth sector bodies, some practitioner organisations have argued that measuring predefined outcomes is inconsistent with youth work. Impact is associated with the quantitative measurement of planned outcomes, such as through 'pre and post' tests or randomised control trials. However, personal and social development are notoriously difficult to measure, and impact tools themselves can be inappropriate in youth work settings: for example, questionnaires asking young people about their attitudes or behaviour can be intrusive, particularly early on in a young person's engagement. Impact measurement is particularly challenging in community-based open youth work settings, where outcomes emerge gradually over time rather than being pre-defined.

The youth impact agenda has quickly become influential, yet we know little about how it has been implemented in open youth work settings, or what effects it has had on practice. This is important: if funding is tied to quantitative measures of impact, then it will be difficult for open youth work to demonstrate its value according to those measures, and a valuable tradition of practice built up over more than a century might be lost. Even less is known about how young people experience and perceive impact mechanisms; young people are not a homogeneous group, and it could be that some groups of young people gain satisfaction from reflecting on their outcomes, while others might find impact-related questioning intrusive and off-putting.

This three-year research project will involve 146 participants in qualitative interviews, focus groups, participant observations and youth participatory methods (photography, peer interviewing and film-making). It will find out how the youth impact agenda is implemented in practice, and how impact processes are experienced and perceived by young people and youth workers. It will include the perspectives of funding agencies and policy makers, and explore how and why 'youth impact' has become so important at this time. Research findings will be shared in peer-reviewed journals, conference presentations, and a symposium to discuss policy and impact in the wider social sector. Findings will be disseminated widely through a short film (made and disseminated by young people); a series of deliberative discussions involving practitioners, managers, funders and policy makers/influencers; policy and practice briefings; and a practitioner conference to share approaches to evaluation and accountability that are congruent with open youth work.","1) Young people, particularly those who participate in youth work. Youth work is usually open to all young people of around 11-19 years in age, and is often attractive to and aimed at groups who are marginalised or disadvantaged by mainstream services.
1a) During the project: 60 young people will take part in interviews and/or focus groups, enabling them to reflect on their journeys through youth work and their experiences of youth work monitoring, measurement and evaluation. 20 young people will be involved in participatory youth research, including peer interviewing and photo-voice methods. 10 will plan, make and evaluate a film, drawing on the research findings, which they will use as the basis of workshops in other youth clubs. An additional 45 (3 groups of 15) will take part in these workshops, discussing and debating youth work's value and how it is / should be evaluated. Over 100 young people will view the film on social media. 2 young adults (recent youth work participants) will be on the Advisory Group. 
1b) After the project: it is hoped that thousands of young people taking part in youth services in the UK and internationally will benefit through the project's contribution to better evidenced services, more congruent evaluation and accountability mechanisms, and more youth-centred evaluation in youth work.

2) Youth workers, managers, youth organisations (local authority, voluntary sector, social enterprises).
2a) During the project: 12 youth organisations (8 UK, 4 USA) will participate directly in the research. 42 youth workers, 12 managers and 12 administrators will take part in interviews / focus groups, providing an opportunity to reflect on the value and impact of youth work and its evaluation. Two in-depth case study organisations and their employees will benefit additionally from more in-depth discussions on evaluation, and from collaborating with the research team on youth participatory research. 70 practitioners and managers will benefit through involvement in round-table workshops and the practitioner conference. 3 experienced youth workers will be on the Advisory Group. Over 200 practitioners and managers from the voluntary sector, public sector and social enterprises will view the young people's film, and read accessible practice briefings, blog posts, short articles, and open access academic publications. 
2b) After the project: it is hoped that hundreds of youth workers, managers and organisations will have more awareness of, and confidence to use, youth-centred and practice-oriented approaches to evaluation, and that they will benefit from more awareness amongst funders and policy makers of youth-centred evaluation methods.

3) Policy makers / influencers, funding agencies, third sector organisations in the areas of youth work, youth impact or charitable / public service impact. These groups overlap in the youth sector, where key charities and social enterprises are particularly influential on policy and practice.
3a) During the project: 4 representatives of influential third sector organisations, 2 with significant policy influence, will be on the advisory group. 12 policy makers / advisors (UK) and 8 experts / informants (USA) will be interviewed, providing opportunities for reflection on the policy process around youth impact, and how youth impact is perceived and experienced in youth work settings. 12 funder representatives and 12 policy makers / influencers will take part in round-table discussions to develop alternative approaches to impact. 3 from each group will be brought together with practitioners and managers for a final round-table to discuss ways forward. The research team will publish and disseminate short policy briefings, and will be prepared to contribute to existing and unanticipated policy processes.
3b) After the project: It is hoped that these groups will be more informed on using practice-oriented, youth-centred approaches to accountability and evaluation.","Tania de St Croix","Education","Social Policy","Social Work","Children and Families","Social Policy","Sociology of Education",NA,NA,NA

However, speech processing rarely takes place in ideal, laboratory-like environments. Instead, listeners must often contend with a backdrop of distracting noise or competing talkers (e.g., in cafeterias). Understanding speech in adverse conditions is known to rely on the integrity of domain-general cognitive functions (e.g., executive function, selective attention, processing speed). However, these higher-order cognitive capacities diminish with age. Owing to the combined effects of reduced sensory abilities (e.g., a hearing loss), an aging cognitive system, and the ubiquity of noise and other distractors in everyday listening environments, spoken language processing is often considered challenging and 'effortful' for older adults. However, the extent to which factors independent of hearing ability, namely attention and motivation, influence effortful listening in older adults remains unclear. 

One way to examine the effect of listener-controlled processes on effortful listening is by manipulating the cost/reward trade-off and measuring online changes in physiological arousal. Intentional Listening (IL) refers to the strategic use of attention during listening; a process thought to be influenced by motivation. By examining IL during adverse conditions, this project aims to explore the cognitive and physiological mechanisms that optimise the ability to overcome everyday listening challenges for older adults. The need to address communication difficulties in older adults is more critical than ever before owing to a rapidly growing elderly population. A better understanding of the communicative barriers faced by older adults, and crucially the ways in which they can be overcome, will help to mitigate social isolation and improve quality of life.

This project will systematically test the predictions of a new Framework for Understanding Effortful Listening (FUEL) by teasing apart the complex interactions between IL, physiological arousal, and cognitive ability. The first aim of the project is to establish the relationship between physiological arousal and IL in young versus older adults using pupillometry. Pupillometry is an eye tracking technique that reveals moment-to-moment changes in physiological arousal and attention. The second aim of this project is to identify potential age-related differences in sustained attention by examining the time course of changes in physiological arousal during listening. The third aim is to uncover potential cognitive predictors of IL-based changes in physiological arousal by analysing individual differences in various cognitive abilities. Lastly, eye tracking techniques will be used to examine the influence of IL on the use of top-down (lexical-semantic) versus bottom-up (sensory) processing strategies in older adults. The visual world paradigm is now widely used in psycholinguistic research to investigate the precise timing of top-down processing operations (e.g., semantic integration) during spoken language understanding. Examining the effect of IL on the use of top-down processing strategies in older adults will help to elucidate the compensatory mechanisms that underlie IL-based changes in listening during adverse conditions.

In summary, findings from this project will elucidate the impact of IL for elderly listeners in adverse conditions and, in doing so, will contribute to our theoretical understanding of the cognitive and physiological mechanisms that underlie effortful listening and how these processes undergo change into late adulthood.","The most direct beneficiaries of the proposed work will be scientific researchers in the fields of hearing science and cognitive ageing. However, the theoretical and methodological knowledge gained from the proposed research will also benefit end-users in the wider society including clinical practitioners, educators, and more generally those with an interest in improving quality of life in the elderly population.

The need to address communication difficulties in older adults is abundantly clear in a rapidly growing elderly population. A better understanding of the listening challenges faced by older adults will help to prevent social isolation and reduce the likelihood of mental health issues. Reducing social isolation is especially pertinent in an age where widespread use of modern technologies (e.g., smart phones, social networking) has propagated a generational gap, engendering a sense of alienation in the elderly population.

Our research has the potential to encourage widening participation in higher education for older adults, like York's University of the Third Age (www.yorku3a.com). By exploring the mechanisms underlying effortful listening, this project aims to shed light on the ways in which older adults can take control of their learning and communication outcomes by optimising speech understanding in naturalistic environments. Societal impact will be achieved by addressing fundamental research questions such as: to what extent can elderly listeners use cognition to reduce communication difficulties in adverse conditions? Which cognitive skills best predict benefit from effortful listening in older adults? Answers to these questions are also likely to benefit other populations that experience listening difficulties (e.g., hearing-impaired individuals, non-native language speakers, individuals with learning difficulties). For example, listening strategies that will optimise the ability to learn a new language will be of interest to the increasing number of individuals who seek to acquire second language fluency (e.g., through higher education groups or online courses). 

The PI's active involvement in the BSA Special Interest Group on Hearing and Cognition will serve as a platform for liaising with clinical practitioners, educators, and industrial partners on ways to incorporate the role of cognition during targeted interventions (e.g., speech perception training, hearing devices) for elderly and/or hearing-impaired listeners who struggle in noise. Findings from this project will help to signal a fundamental shift in focus from enhancing sensory acuity alone to the added consideration of cognitive factors that help to restore communicative function in elderly and/or hearing-impaired listeners. Raising awareness of the ways in which individuals can take control of their listening outcomes is not only a novel approach to the study of listening in adverse conditions, it will also likely help to promote a sense of empowerment in individuals who may otherwise find certain everyday listening environments (e.g., cafeterias, restaurants) intimidating due to excessive background noise. 

Ultimately, addressing the barriers associated with cognitive and sensory decline in elderly listeners by promoting social interaction and effective communication strategies will help to improve quality of life in a rapidly-ageing society.","Ronan Arthur McGarrigle","Psychology","Cognitive Psychology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, despite decades of research, we still do not know how this is achieved. One clue - so far unstudied - arises from our perception of faces as they age. For those around us, we typically only notice face changes when shown an old picture. For famous people, some have spent a lifetime in the public eye (The Queen, Paul McCartney); whereas others are famous for more limited times periods (Angela Merkel, Meghan Markle). How do we represent these people in order to recognise them? In this project, I will study the psychological mechanisms that allow us to recognise the same face across substantial changes. For example, do we need multiple representations of The Queen or Paul McCartney, or have we somehow developed representations of them that are sufficiently general to work across the huge range of their photos? For people known over a more limited time, how well do our representations generalise? Could we recognise Mrs Merkel at 20? In these ways I will study the fundamental processes of face recognition - how do we recognise one another? However, I will be taking advantage of natural changes that occur around us throughout life - changes that are typically ignored in face recognition research, but which I believe could provide critical evidence. 

Changes over time are also a problem for unfamiliar face processing. For example, our passports can be up to ten years old, and yet a viewer checking our identity must nevertheless make the match. It has been known for many years that unfamiliar face matching is difficult, and it becomes more difficult with larger time intervals between photos. In this project, I will study this problem, and establish the circumstances under which unfamiliar face recognition is prone to age changes, and how this is mitigated by the method of presentation (for example, should a younger image be presented before an older image?). We know that some people are particularly good at unfamiliar face matching - people known as super-recognisers are employed in some police and security settings. However, we do not know whether these people are especially good at generalising photos across age ranges. I will test this, and use the results to establish recommendations for selection and training of personnel in these key roles. 

In summary, the project examines face recognition across changes in age, using this natural process as an opportunity to gain understanding of a fundamental human ability - our ability to recognise one another.","The findings from this research will shed new light on our mental representations of faces and examine the face-matching abilities of super-recognisers and typical observers when images of the same face differ in age. This research will therefore benefit stakeholders across a wide range of settings: (a) the use of photo ID in security settings; (b) missing persons, policing and the justice system; (c) charities working with older adults and their families; and (d) the general public. 

(a) The use of photo ID in security settings

This research aims to improve the use of photo ID when there is an age gap between images by examining factors that affect the ability to recognise two different images of the same person. This is important for national security, such as ensuring photographs attached to passport applications match their holder: HM Passport Office receives 5,000,000 applications for new passports every year with many applications being to renew passports. The proposed research will test whether the age range and order of images helps or hinders unfamiliar face matching. The research will also look at individuals' differences and how super-recognisers (people with above average face recognition abilities) perform in extremely challenging circumstances. This information will be useful for personnel selection and procedures used in security settings. Recruiting super-recognisers might be one way to reduce fraud, if it can be shown that this group excels at unfamiliar face matching despite ageing. Super-recognisers are already working in some applied settings, such as the Metropolitan Police, with promising results. 

(b) Missing persons, policing and the justice system

Successful person identification despite facial ageing is relied upon in a range of contexts, such as finding missing persons or identifying a suspect in old CCTV footage. This research will benefit families and police officers trying to locate people who have been missing for many years. The range of images a family chooses to release to the media for publicity might increase the chance that a person is recognised. The present research will also benefit law enforcement officers by advancing our understanding of the abilities of typical observers and super-recognisers when there is time gap between a suspect's past and present appearance. Evidence provided by the general population and super-recognisers is used in criminal investigations. If it is found that super-recognisers, like the general population, are prone to error in challenging circumstances involving recognising an ageing face, their testimony should be treated with caution; conversely, if super-recognisers perform well, more weight might be given to their evidence. 

(c) Charities working with older adults and their families. 

The Alzheimer's Society (2017) suggests there are currently 850,000 people living with dementia in the UK. Face recognition impairments associated with this disorder can be distressing for the person with dementia, and also their family and friends. This research seeks better to understand representations of familiar faces in healthy older adults. Improved understanding of the profile of face perception in healthy ageing will therefore inform future research investigating impairments associated with different forms of dementia (e.g. diagnosis, sub-types, and treatment).
 
(d) General public

The general public is an important beneficiary of this research. This research will be disseminated to the general public through a series of planned events. Media engagement and the project website will also raise public access to research findings and implications. It is also expected that the public will benefit as a consequence of (a), (b) and (c) e.g. due to increased national security.","Sarah Laurence","Psychology","Cognitive Psychology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the UK, air pollution leads to the loss of 340,000 years of life each year and workplace cancers led to the loss of over 140,000 years of life in 2010. Government policies can address the many causes of premature fatality, but these policies need to be evaluated to ensure they make the best use of public money. The question then becomes: what is the value of increasing a person's life expectancy? 

To address this question, researchers have introduced the concept of the Value Of a Life Year (VOLY). This VOLY is used in government policy evaluations as a measure of the benefits of policies including air pollution mitigation and workplace safety regulation, and thus it is crucial it is measured accurately. 

The VOLY is estimated using surveys of members of the public, in which people state how much they would pay for a given reduction in their risk of dying, or for a given increase in their life expectancy. The benefits being valued occur in the future. Crucially then, a key component of the VOLY is the effect of timing. Put simply, the further in the future something is, the less we tend to care about it. So a reduction in our risk of dying this year might be more valuable than a reduction in our risk of dying in the future, even if the effect on our overall life expectancy is the same. Unless we understand the influence of this 'discounting' for changes in life expectancy, we cannot accurately disentangle it from the true VOLY. This is the problem we aim to solve with our research.

To solve it, our team of experimental economists will use an innovative mixture of experiments and surveys. Participants will play experimental games designed to include simplified models of the air pollution policies, so our team can learn the best ways to describe and measure discounting as it relates to delayed changes in risk. The survey will use the insights from the experiment and elicit individuals' preferences for reductions in their risks at different points in the future. Taken together, the experiments and survey will provide the first major investigation into how people discount their future life expectancy in the context of the VOLY.

Our results will be important for policymakers in two ways. First, unless we can account for the effects of discounting on the VOLY, then policy estimates of the VOLY taken from current surveys might be wrong. If these incorrect estimates are used in the evaluation of policies aimed at improving life expectancy, then the value of the policies will be over- or under-estimated, which means public money is likely to be spent on the wrong policies. Second, when the government is evaluating policies where improvements in life expectancy happen in the future, as is the case for air pollution policies, they have to apply discounting to the value of the benefits. Our research will provide evidence about how governments should discount future gains in life expectancy, to make sure that public preferences are reflected in policymaking. 

Our research is also academically cutting-edge. It combines models from economics with insights from psychology to generate new methodological and empirical evidence about how discounting influences preferences for changes in risk, both for money outcomes (in the experiments) and for fatality risks (in the surveys). It also forges a new methodological agenda, which is the incorporation of incentivised experiments into policy-driven research projects.

Overall, our research aims to provide the basis for changing the VOLY used in government policy, challenge existing guidance for discounting fatality risk reductions, and ultimately change how government money is spent, so that the policies implemented are those that improve the wellbeing of society.","What is an additional year of life expectancy worth to society? This question lies at the heart of the evaluation of government policies that reduce risks of premature fatality. The proposed research addresses a core question relating to the evaluation of the monetary value of life expectancy gains: how does the 'value of a life year' (VOLY) change according to its timing?

Our main beneficiaries will be policymakers across UK and EU governments. We will use the context of Air Pollution in our survey, so the immediate beneficiaries will be policymakers in the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs evaluating policies targeting pollution in the air and water. Yet the methods and insights will be transferable across government departments to any policy context that delivers improvements in life expectancy.

Our project is timely, since a cross-governmental group of departments and agencies is currently focussed on clarifying general issues in the valuation of fatality outcomes. Our research fits very well into this framework, since it addresses the discounting of fatality outcomes; a concept of fundamental importance, yet one that is poorly understood. These departments and agencies include the Department of Health which evaluates life-extending interventions; the Department of Transport which evaluates interventions to prevent road traffic fatalities; and the Treasury, which provides cross-governmental guidance on the valuation of non-market outcomes. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) evaluates policies using estimates of the Value of Prevented Fatalities (VPF), and is our Project Partner. Beyond UK government, the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) has also expressed interest and will contribute to the project. The HSE's and ECHA's input will help shape the research questions and design and help identify routes by which the results can influence policy.

We will host a Stakeholders' workshop to bring policymakers and academics together to discuss issues surrounding discounting, the monetary VOLY and related topics. It will combine academic presentations of policy-relevant research with policy-led sessions. This will allow us to showcase the results, increase their visibility in policy circles, strengthen our network with policymakers as well as other existing relationships between academia and policy, and provide opportunities to identify knowledge gaps for future research. We will also disseminate the research to the policymakers identified as the most relevant by presenting in their analytical seminar series and engaging with their relevant committees, to identify remaining barriers to policy change and develop strategies to overcome these. All of our research outputs will be collated on our webpage to maximise the visibility of the findings.

We anticipate our research findings will demonstrate that existing assumptions about discounting underlying the calculation of the VOLY need to be updated - even completely overturned. If so, two specific changes to policy would be called for. First, the VOLY would need to be re-estimated, which could dramatically change the implied monetary value of reducing fatalities attributable to air pollution, as well as a range of other causes of premature fatality. This would change the viability of policies, including those addressing air pollution, and potentially shape government spending. Second, we would call for a fundamental change in discounting advice for public sector policy appraisal of mortality outcomes. For air pollution, guidance currently recommends that costs are subject to discounting at 3.5% per year (declining after the first 30 years), as set out in the Treasury's Green Book. Our research will test whether this practice reflects public preferences. Our research will also provide evidence about the compatibility of the VOLY and VPF approaches to mortality risk evaluation, which is a key concern for the new government initiative.","Rebecca McDonald","Economics","Behavioural & experimental eco","Environmental economics","Microeconomic theory","Public economics",NA,NA,NA,NA

This is reflected in the style of parliamentary politics at Westminster, in which an elected government is opposed by the 'Official Opposition'. Debate tends to move between the two. Observers of the weekly Prime Minister's Question Time will see a prime demonstration of this, when the leader of the Official Opposition is granted the privilege of speaking from the dispatch box (something which is denied to the leaders of all other parties), and has the opportunity to ask up to six questions to the Prime Minister. The leader of the second opposition party receives two questions. Smaller opposition parties receive no such guarantee of a question. This two party dominance is therefore reinforced by parliamentary procedures, which grant greater speaking time as well as committee memberships to the largest opposition party. 

But small parties have played pivotal roles throughout nineteenth and twentieth century UK politics. They have become even more popular in the twenty first century as the appeal of the large parties has waned amidst a somewhat disillusioned electorate. The Labour Party and the Conservative party were regularly polling over 90% of the vote in the mid twentieth century, but managed only 67% in 2015.This gap is being filled by smaller parties, of which over 300 are currently registered with the UK Electoral Commission. These parties are contesting more seats than ever before in local elections and, crucially, they are winning a significant number of seats in national elections, to the UK Parliament and the devolve assemblies of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Ten political parties were represented in the House of Commons after the 2015 General Election, with a total of 85 MPs between them (accounting for 13% of the chamber). In fact, 2015 saw the best General Election performance ever for UKIP, the SNP and the Green Party. This fell to only 6 parties in the 2017 general election, but the unexpected hung parliament has seen one small party (the DUP) and has potentially empowered all other small parties in the chamber. In addition to this presence at Westminster, 19 parties have representation in the UK's sub national parliaments. Although the sub-national parliaments of the UK have more consensual practices, existing research still proceeds as though the 'opposition' is one parliamentary grouping. As such we still know little about the role of individual parties in these parliaments. But there has been an almost complete neglect of the role of individual small parties within these parliaments. 

This three year project aims to better understand the work of small political parties in the British House of Commons, the Northern Ireland Assembly, Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly. It uses large scale interviews with MPs and assembly members and analysis of key parliamentary documents, debates, questions and amendments to pieces of legislation since 2015 to investigate the role which small parties play in our political system. In doing so, in considers the challenges they face in parliamentary institutions and the impact they are able to make on scrutiny of government and of legislation. In doing so, it will highlight an area of parliamentary life which is usually hidden, uncovering best practice which will be shared with parliamentary officials, MPs and staff.","The primary beneficiaries of this research are parliamentary practitioners, political party staff and elected representatives working within Westminster and the devolved parliaments. These individuals are responsible for promoting, supporting or integrating the work of small political parties into the everyday work of parliamentary politics. The general public are a secondary audience. This will include those seeking information about the role and work of small parties. This audience is both UK wide and region-specific, depending on the political party and institution in question. The status of the general public as potential beneficiary will increase considerably shortly before, and during, parliamentary elections. Although scheduled for 2021 (Wales, Scotland) and 2022 (UK) they may well take place during the research period itself. A third beneficiary are parliamentary correspondents working within the four legislatures. Correspondents will be interested in the day-to-day work of small parties, particularly around key events or votes in the chambers. Most importantly, they are key mediators as they communicate the work of parliament and its members to a broader media audience. 

The research is designed to maximise the potential for the project to appeal to these beneficiaries. Most importantly, its direction will be influenced by the relevant parliamentary practitioners who will help to co-design the research. These key stakeholders will be involved form the very beginning of the project, acting as gatekeepers but also ensuring that the project aligns well with parliamentary and committee interests, as well as with any forthcoming committee inquiries. This will provide a firm foundation for the research to have impact. 

As would be expected, the planned dissemination activities are based heavily around practitioners. The PI will apply for a House of Commons Parliamentary Fellowship at the start of the project. This will facilitate access to practitioners and facilitate the participation of parliamentary staff at Westminster with the research. Research findings will be presented at the leading parliamentary workshops in the discipline (e.g. the Study of Parliament Group Annual Conference). The highlight of the research dissemination is the end of project workshop. This workshop plays a key role in bringing academic and practitioner beneficiaries together and in encouraging discussions in a cross-institutional setting. This will be an effective way to encourage changes to better integrate small parties. 

Alongside this academic and practitioner dissemination sits an ongoing, but less structured set of dissemination activities aimed at the general public. To be most effective, dissemination in this area needs to be planned around specific events in the four parliaments, or in UK Politics. The PI will use well known existing media outlets (e.g. The Conversation) with a large existing reader base to promote the research to the wider public when relevant. Opportunities for dissemination are likely to be much greater around the time of parliamentary elections in 2021/22 and this timing fits neatly with the end of the planned period of research. The strategy here will be responsive to issues as they arise on the political agenda, but it is likely to include issues such as the impact of small parties on specific policy areas, the benefits (or not) of voting for small party candidates and the likelihood of smaller parties being electorally successful. The flexibility built into the project, with a staggered approach to the study of each legislature and the selection of case study bills being carried out following research interviews, the research will be able to be adapted to take account of any unanticipated changes, or any new issues in the parliaments being studied.","Louise Thompson","Pol. sci. & internat. studies","Political Science","Politics",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This innovative global research, informed by transitional and regulatory theories, aims at maximising the opportunities to inform and underpin such a paradigm shift in the banking sector. It will do so by exploring the role and potential of 'values-based banks' - that is small and niche banks which adhere to Principles of Sustainable Banking (2011) and are values-driven rather than exclusively profit-driven - to inform the re-shaping of global banking regulation. In order to realise this ambition, it is proposed to co-create and conduct this timely and topical research over three years in partnership with both the Global Alliance for Banking on Values (GABV) which currently represents 40 small commercial banks, credit unions, microfinance banks globally (including the UK), and with the World Bank (WB), which made a formal offer to provide the necessary leverage for this research. 

The research is set within the ongoing debate over the role of the financial and banking sector in achieving sustainable development (SD). The concept of sustainable banking is complex as it relates to the goals of balancing the social, environmental and financial aspects of banking business and using banking services to achieve social and environmental long-term impacts. The current focus of the global banking regulation is on the largest and frequently described as the 'too big to fail' banks identified by the Financial Stability Board (FSB). Small banks are well positioned to have SD as the core of their practices but their potential to inform global banking regulation is unexplored. Following innovative sampling informed by transitional and regulatory theories, the research will draw from the experience of GABV niche banks.

The study will be conducted over two Phases by taking a mixed methods approach: a desk based review and a triangulation of quantitative and qualitative data. Two placements will facilitate access and the adequate collection of data: a 6-month placement at GABV and a 3-month placement at the WB. The research will actively involve NGOs, which follow the current debates on SD banking regulation (eg. Friends of the Earth, Finance Watch).
Phase 1 will identify values-based banks' innovative and niche sustainable development practices and assess how far these practices can and should inform global banking regulation via surveys and interviews. For example values-based banks' social engagement practices may constitute best SD practice but may be of little use for global banking regulation. Alternatively, these banks may have particularly strong environmental disclosure practices which could be included in global regulation. The research will identify the preferred regulatory strategies for embedding the innovative and niche SD strategies into global regulation via a focus group, which will meet several times.

Phase 2 will assess and test Phase 1 proposals with the global banking regulators (such as FSB) and the largest global banks (such as Barclays Bank) via surveys, interviews and focus groups. Ultimately, it will identify those values-based banks' practices that can be taken up realistically by the global regulators. Phase 2 will also lead to establishing a Stakeholder Forum, whose mandate will be to promote Phase 2 findings and ensure they are on the global regulators' agenda. 

The research will lead to producing several high-quality outputs, including a planned monograph, four journal articles, two impact reports, and developing interdisciplinary links. It will benefit several stakeholders such as GABV, the World Bank, global regulators, NGOs, and large banks.","This research aims to inform a paradigm shift from the mainstream economic model of banking regulation to a people-oriented sustainable approach by exploring the potential of values-based banks to shape global banking regulation. The integration of social and environmental matters into such regulation will have huge impact on improving the well-being of people in the long-term. In realising this ambition, the research has a clear social and economic value evidenced by partnerships with the Global Alliance for Banking on Values (GABV) and the World Bank (WB). The following organisations will benefit from the research: 

1) GABV: is keen to learn how their practices could inform global banking regulation (see letter of support) hence this research will help the alliance to understand and seize its potential. It is argued that GABV is the emerging global 'epistemic community' thus well positioned to engage with the global banking regulation (evidenced also by the WB's interest in this project) and this research will contribute to realising GABV's potential by drawing data from its banks. 
2) WB, a key global institution and research user, has been at the forefront of integrating sustainable development (SD) in investment projects. WB confirmed (see letter of support) they would benefit from this research to inform the implementation of its Environmental and Social Framework (eg. Standard 9, Financial Intermediaries). 
2) Global banking regulators engaged in this research: the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and members of the emerging Sustainable Banking Network. These organisations include membership from the Finance Ministers, Governors of Central Banks, banking supervisors and other institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, European Union. These institutions will benefit from having access to findings from the rigorous research and, in turn, will be able to use these findings to inform their policy-making.
3) The Globally Systematically Important Banks - G-SIBs - (ie. 30 biggest global banks on the 2016 FSB list, such as Barclays and Bank of America that are target groups for this research) will gain greater understanding of how small and niche banks conduct their business and will be able to use this knowledge to inform their policies and strategies on sustainable banking. Other large banks that can be named as G-SIBs in the future (eg. regional systemically important banks) will benefit from the lessons learned in a similar fashion. 
4) NGOs following the global debates on sustainable banking regulation (eg. Friends of the Earth, Finance Watch) will be consulted by the PI and gain unique insight into the capacities of values-based banks to inform global banking regulation. This, in turn, will enable them to run evidence-based campaigns on SD banking regulation and form adequate coalitions when pressing for the paradigm shift. 
5) The United Nations. By bringing together GABV and WB the research will directly contribute to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals aimed at combatting poverty. In particular, the research will align with the SDG Goal 17 which promotes multi-stakeholder partnerships. Various policy reforms are needed &quot;to redirect and unlock the transformative power of trillions of dollars of private resources to deliver on sustainable development objectives&quot; (UN SDG Goal 17 website).
7) Other initiatives promoting the integration of sustainable development factors in investment projects, beyond banking, such as the London Principles on SD Finance 2002, International Capital Market Association's Green Bond Principles, and the UN's' endorsed Principles of Responsible Investment. Such initiatives may use this research as a case study on how sustainable finance practices can influence global banking regulations. This, in turn, may foster the process of building stronger links between these initiatives in the spirit of SDG Goal 17.","Radek Stech","Economics","Law & legal studies","Economics","Socio Legal Studies",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Children's language development is strongly related to the language that they hear in their environment (Hart &amp; Risley, 1995) and research suggests that parental screen media use reduces the quality and amount of language spoken to their children (Christakis, Gilkerson, Richards, Zimmerman, Garrison et al., 2009; Kirkorian, Pempek, Murphy, Schmidt, &amp; Anderson, 2009; Pempek, Kirkorian, &amp; Anderson, 2014; Radesky, Silverstein, Zuckerman, &amp; Christakis, 2014). At the same time, screen media has the potential to provide a valuable source of language input and educational entertainment for young children. The American Academy of Paediatrics (AAP) have recently revised their recommendations for children's screen media use to account for this educational potential (AAP, 2016). The AAP encourage children aged 2-5 years to use screen media but restrict their recommendations to high quality educational screen media which should be used alongside their parents and caregivers and for less than 1 hour per day (AAP, 2016). The question remains however, what constitutes educational screen media for young children? For touchscreen apps, a recent review paper highlighted that apps that promote active, engaged, meaningful and socially interactive learning have the potential to educate young children (Hirsh-Pasek, Zosh, Golinkoff, Gray, Robb &amp; Kaufman, 2015). While 72% of apps aimed at children are classed as &quot;educational&quot; (Shuler, Levine &amp; Ree, 2012), there is little research evidence to back up or contradict these claims. Clearer evidence and guidelines for children's educational apps would provide invaluable knowledge for caregivers, early years practitioners and children's app developers.

The aim of this project is to investigate children's language learning apps to develop a scientific understanding of the app marketplace and to apply developmental theories of learning, memory and language acquisition to the development of educational touchscreen apps. The proposed project will combine a systematic review of the children's educational app marketplace with a series of empirical studies to explore how children learn language from touchscreen apps and digital media. The first phase of this project, a systematic review of the app marketplace, will to determine the educational potential for apps currently available to children using theories of language acquisition. These findings will then guide a series of empirical studies investigating children's app interaction and language learning outcomes. Furthermore, we will determine the role of caregiver interaction during children's app use on children's language learning outcomes to provide evidence on the AAP (2016) recommendation for parental co-use during children's screen media use. Across these studies, this project will advance our understanding of educational touchscreen apps designed to teach children language by providing evidence-based guidelines for touchscreen apps and contributing to the development of an evidence based word learning app. This project will also make important theoretical contributions to theories of word learning by incorporating evidence for word learning from digital media and as a result promote the development of evidence-based educational screen media for young children.","The proposed research addresses the ESRC's strategic priority of new ways of being in a digital age. Our impact pathway ensures that our research on children's early learning from touchscreen apps has outcomes in terms of societal impact extending beyond apps with applications to children's learning from digital media more generally. We have identified three main beneficiaries: 1) app developers, 2) early years practitioners and 3) caregivers and children from both low and higher SES backgrounds. It is anticipated that proposed project will have a major impact for these beneficiaries by providing an insight into the way in which children learn from touchscreen apps and digital media. 

Industry. We have approached two companies who work with children's educational apps, Pearson and Fundamentally Children. We will inform these companies about the progress of the project on an annual basis and anticipate that development projects for children's digital media will be informed by this research. We expect further impact from the proposed work through the development of a number of guidelines for the development of educational apps for young children.

Early Years Practitioners. One of the core early learning goals in Department for Education's Statutory Framework for the Early Years (2014) is that children can &quot;select and use technology for particular purposes&quot; (p. 12). We will liaise with early years practitioners on a regular basis throughout the project when recruiting and testing children for our empirical research studies, through this contact we will inform early years practitioners on best practices for children's digital technology use based on academic research. 

Caregivers. Given the prevalence of screen media in young children's lives, caregivers will benefit from having a greater understanding about children's learning capabilities. Through regular contact with caregivers during the research process, we will be able communicate clear guidelines to determine whether educational apps are appropriate or not and inform caregivers about best practices when using screen media with children. 

General Public. The research is also of general interest and relevance to the broader public. Our impact pathway includes regular press releases on the results of the studies, as well as outreach events in public understanding of science events. We will contribute to events such as the British Science Festival and the Manchester Science Festival, and local science organisation events, such as Caf&eacute; Scientifique. The proposed work will therefore have a positive impact on the public understanding of science.","Padraic Monaghan","Info. & commun.

Initially intended as a measure to encourage trust, understanding and cooperation between fragmented nations in the wake WWII, during the latter half of the twentieth century the practice of twinning extended from Europe all across the globe, taking a variety of new and interesting forms. However, the value of town twinning - with both European and more international constituencies - has recently been questioned in the UK media and in Parliament. Some suggest that twinning has little utility for local publics in an age of globalisation and mass tourism, whilst others have linked twinning to 'junkets' that only serve to benefit local councillors. In the wake of the 2008 economic crisis, local council funding for twinning related activities was slashed all across the UK. In spite of this, many projects have survived, running on the steam, initiative and sustained engagement of an assortment of trans-local groups. How have they survived? What kinds of benefits are derived from engaging with these initiatives? Why do arts and cultural exchanges feature so prominently among twinning activities? 

Notably, although term 'friendship' is ubiquitous across policy documentation, civil society campaigns and other materials relating to twinning, scholarly work in this area is extremely limited. In academe, 'international friendships' are commonly defined as strategic or diplomatic alliances among states. Yet a top-down and state-centric characterisation fails to capture the wider web of factors that can foster and sustain friendships that cross borders, including solidarity, empathy, art production and inter-cultural exchange. At a time when social fragmentation and cultural polarisation appear to be on the rise, this research project seeks to advance academic and practical understandings of 'international friendship' by focussing on the civic and political value of town twinning. In particular, by weaving together concepts and methods drawn from International Relations, Social Movement Studies, and Aesthetics, it will generate new insights into how cross-border 'friendships' are experienced, understood and maintained by state and non-state actors operating across the local, national and international levels. 

The proposed project engages policy officials, civil society actors and arts partners in key aspects of both the research design and dissemination phases. It promises to generate original qualitative data and conceptual advances which will be of relevance to the work of these groups, but also has a wider relevance for members of the general public and academe. Unfolding in interrelated six strands or work packages, it will meld desk based research with interviews, ethnographic and arts-based techniques. In this way, it will build on both the sensibilities and methods that the Principle Investigator (PI) has developed in her work to date which has addressed the political role of art in Latin America. It will also enable the PI to further hone her research methods and leadership capacity through a comprehensive programme of skills development addressing visual methodologies, in-depth interviewing and languages, all of which will serve to complement and strengthen the project.","Why is this project important and for whom? 

International Policy-makers - The notion of 'value' in policymaking circles is increasingly tied to the needs of economics, business and accounting. Social, civic and political value are much harder to quantify than economic value but they are nonetheless important considerations for policy-making. This project will build an evidence base on 'value' that goes beyond 'the economic offer' of twinning. Beyond this, undertaking this research project will also make the PI well-situated to address emerging questions about the nature, evolution and worth of European cultural diplomacy in the wider context of the 'Brexit' process. 

Twinning Organisations and Solidarity Movements - In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, twinning projects were hard-hit by local government funding cuts. Rather little research on the value of twinning exists which might provide a basis for: a) evaluating the impact of existing projects b) challenging divestments from existing twinning projects; and/or, c) establishing new links in the future. 

The General Public - Public understanding of 'what twinning delivers' is limited and has been compounded by a great deal of critical media coverage in recent years. In the public imaginary, twinning is often linked to &quot;jollies, junkets, and jamborees&quot; for local councillors (Clarke 2009). This project will enhance public understanding of what 'twinning' is and who it serves. Among other things, the project will illuminate the work of activist and community organisations in advancing international friendships that have potential to deliver benefits across diverse constituencies. 

Academia - The term 'friendship' is ubiquitous across twinning projects yet scholarly work in this area is extremely limited. In International Relations, 'international friendships' are commonly defined as strategic alliances among governments. Whilst this top-down approach featured strongly in the early history of twinning, it does not tell the whole story. This project will examine alternative drivers of friendships that cross borders, including solidarity, empathy and trans-local cultural exchange. In so doing, it will bring together distinct bodies of theorising (on political theory, social movements, aesthetics and emotions) and offer new analytical tools.","Holly Ryan","History","Pol. sci. & internat. studies","Visual arts","Applied Arts HTP","Diplomacy & Internat Relations","Economic & Social History","International Relations Theory","Politics",NA

When this need to belong is not met, there are serious negative consequences for physical and mental health. Indeed, loneliness puts people at as much risk of early death as smoking, and at greater risk than obesity (Holt-Lunstad, Smith &amp; Layton, 2010). Loneliness is a widespread social issue in the UK; a recent poll conducted by the Jo Cox commission on loneliness found that &quot;almost three-quarters of older people in the UK are lonely&quot; (The Guardian, 2017). Given the prevalence of loneliness, and its negative consequences, it is crucial to understand the intrapersonal and situational barriers that discourage people from talking to one another, and thus constrain people from fulfilling their need to belong. An understanding of these barriers will form the basis of interventions to encourage more frequent - and more positive - interactions.
 
People generally enjoy socializing and spend a great deal of time talking, but in certain situations they struggle to know what words to say. For example, most people find it challenging to talk to someone who is experiencing a difficult situation (e.g., a cancer diagnosis, the loss of a loved one). It is said that in times of trouble, you find out who your real friends are; the people who let you down decide they're better off to say nothing at all rather than say the &quot;wrong&quot; thing. What exactly are people worried about, and are there actually &quot;wrong&quot; things to say? This project will address these questions, and draw upon the answers to identify ways of increasing the frequency and quality of interactions, thus improving the social support people receive when they need it most.

My recent research has focused on talking to strangers - another situation that finds many people at a loss for words. I have found that, although talking to strangers is generally enjoyable and makes people feel connected, people report a wide range of worries about doing it. The proposed project will build upon this work by examining not only how people feel before social interactions, but also what they say during interactions. Importantly, this project will go beyond the single situation of talking to a stranger, to test the extent to which these predictors of interaction success (i.e., how people feel and what they say) are similar across situations (e.g., talking to a person of a different ethnicity, a wheelchair user, a cancer patient). Evidence of similarities across people and situations will prove invaluable in developing interventions to improve interaction success.
 
This project will begin by collecting descriptive information about 1) the worries people have when considering different types of social interactions (&quot;fears&quot;; e.g., their partner might not talk enough, or might not like them), and 2) the things people wish that others would and would not say (&quot;phrases&quot;; e.g., both cancer patients and people living with disability dislike it when people tell them they're &quot;so brave&quot;). Next, I will extract themes from these qualitative responses, and develop survey instruments to assess fears and phrase use. This will allow me to quantitatively examine the extent to which fears and phrase use vary between people (i.e., related to individual differences) and within people (i.e., related to the situation). Then I will run experiments to examine the effects of fears and phrases on interaction success in real-life social interactions, ultimately testing interventions with the goal of increasing interaction success. 

The research findings will be of interest to health care professionals, and a range of social organisations that work to fight loneliness, to encourage social acceptance and integration (e.g., for the disabled, for minority ethnic people), or to support people confronting difficult situations (e.g., bereavement, serious illness).","The proposed research will uncover the fears that underlie a wide range of social interactions (e.g., talking to a wheelchair user, talking to someone who has been diagnosed with cancer), and test interventions to reduce those fears. The ability to promote more frequent, more positive social interactions is of interest to many groups:

1) Medical professionals

Knowledge about the fears that visitors have, and the phrases that cancer patients dislike/prefer will allow medical professionals to better understand the social interactions that occur between cancer patients and their visitors. This will allow them to encourage more positive interactions, with implications for the well-being of their patients. Although the research focuses specifically on cancer patients, the overarching goal is to identify commonalities across situations, thus the results should be relevant for all patients, not just cancer patients.

The results will be of interest to nursing staff at hospitals and hospices, but also to organisations that have nurses who provide home care. Hospitals might also wish to train the front desk staff who greet visitors and direct them to the right room, to provide information to visitors that might make their visit more positive, both for them and the person they are visiting.
 
2) Third sector

There are many social organisations that work to support people confronting difficult situations (e.g., bereavement, serious illness), to encourage social acceptance and integration (e.g., for the disabled, for minority ethnic people, for refugees), to combat loneliness, or to build a sense of community. Although these organisations differ in many ways, one goal that they share is to improve communication.

Social organisations that support people diagnosed with illnesses (e.g., Macmillan Cancer Support) will be interested in learning how to promote positive social interactions, since effective social support is related to better physical and mental health (Cohen &amp; Wills, 1985; Uchino, Cacioppo &amp; Kiecolt-Glaser). 

Social organisations supporting people at risk of exclusion (e.g., people who live with disability, or people from ethnic minorities; e.g., disability charity Scope, Global Disability Innovation Fund) can help reduce prejudice by promoting more positive interactions (Pettigrew &amp; Tropp, 2006). 

The findings will be of interest to organisations that encourage people to talk to their neighbours (e.g., Talk to each other), especially in diverse communities. There is a growing realization of the importance of a strong sense of community for increasing resilience (Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce, 2013), and improving communication between citizens and local government (City of Vancouver, 2014). 

Loneliness is highly prevalent in the UK; according to one study, 13% of people report being severely lonely (Scharf &amp; de Jong Gierveld, 2008). A better understanding of the fears that people have about talking to strangers could allow organisations (e.g., Campaign to End Loneliness) to promote efforts to address these fears in interactions with older adults, who are at an elevated risk of loneliness.

3) General public

It seems likely that the vast majority of people can recall a time when they had difficulty talking to someone. This research, which seeks to understand which fears are triggered by what situations, will be of interest to anyone seeking to feel more comfortable the next time they encounter one of these situations, or anyone who has goals that involve speaking to new people (e.g., connecting with one's neighbourhood and local community, making friends).

By failing to prioritise this industry, it is widely established that the UK has left the families that depend upon it vulnerable. Hidden within this vulnerability are thousands of women vital to the survival of small-scale fishing businesses.

To explore and raise their profile, this project will examine women's roles, identities and wellbeing in fishing families.

This research is particularly timely as, by exiting the EU, the UK government will be reviewing its support to the fishing industry, making decisions about what type of fishery - and whom within it - should be supported and how.

The research focuses on the roles women play in responding to recent economic downturns in the fishing sector. There are two main ways in which this is done: i) fisheries diversification, and ii) non-fishing employment.

i) Recent research has shown that diversifying fishing businesses - by operating in several different areas to spread the risk of low catches - can help small-scale fishers to create stable incomes [4-6]. Examples of diversification strategies are processing of fish and opening a restaurant where the caught fish can be sold at a higher price. Whilst the contributions of women within fisheries diversification have been noted as important [4], no research to date has explored this in-depth. 

ii) The project will also consider how the fishing family can adapt to economic downturns by seeking non-fishing employment.

Alongside this, previous research has noted that women support the wellbeing and health of their male fishing partners [7,8] but this research has not explored the wellbeing of women themselves.

By responding to these gaps in knowledge, this research will study women's changing roles in fishing families and how this is associated with women's changing identities and their wellbeing. 

To meet the research aims, the research will take place in two phases using a qualitative approach - a method of study which involves interviewing people and listening to their experiences. Phase I will involve a period of in-depth interviews with families in the UK. Information will also be collected in Canada to explore similarities and differences between two countries with different fishing policies.

In exploring these aspects of the fishing family, this research will provide new and vital insights into how fishing families can develop resilience to changes in their industry, and how governments can support this. It will also show how changes in fishing families can affect the wellbeing of women and if more could be done to support them.

In addition to meeting the research aims, the Principal Investigator (PI) will seek to achieve societal impact by convening and leading a series of stakeholder engagements. In particular, the project will establish the platform 'Women In Fishing Families Association' (WIFFA) in collaboration with the project's non-academic Steering Group. Within the WIFFA platform the PI will co-organise one trans-European exchange programme for women in fishing families aiming to develop capacity within the network as well as a Final Workshop were research findings and WIFFA progress will be disseminated and discussed. 

Findings from this research and progress of the WIFFA will be communicated on the project website and in the project Final Booklet. The aim of these stakeholder engagement events is to raise the profile of women in small-scale fishing families in the UK by making their contributions visible and their voices heard.","The impacts this study will generate are twofold: first, it will develop 'conceptual' impact (e.g. reframing debates in public and societal groups) and, second, it will generate 'instrumental impact' (such as influencing the development of policy) [9]. To achieve this, the research engages four target end-groups beyond academia:

1. Women in fishing families: By nuancing the representation of women in fisheries and making visible the 'invisible' contributions of women to the survival of small-scale fishing families, this research will empower this target group to become recognised within the family, community, industry and fishing policies [see 10]. Furthermore, it has been observed that taking part in this kind of narrative research (Phase I) can promote the wellbeing of participants themselves by supporting them in making sense of and articulating their experiences in their own words [11].

2. Local, national and international 'Women in fisheries' groups: The research will support the advocacy work already being done to help women in fisheries by providing much needed evidence on the economic and social position as well as wellbeing of women in fisheries in the UK. Secondly, by engaging these groups throughout the research (e.g. AKTEA and LIFE see 'Letters of Support') the researcher will directly contribute to their existing work. Collaborating like this will create opportunities for mutual learning between different perspectives and cultures, which will feed back into the framing of the research project. Thirdly, the PI will facilitate the development of a UK-based network of women in fishing families (see 'Pathways to Impact').

3. Fishing industry organisations: The research will also be of value to those promoting the small-scale fishing industry at local and national levels. These stakeholders are local fisheries (or 'fishermen's') associations who organise individual small-scale fishers locally and are present all over the UK and beyond. At the national level there are fisheries organisations representing those local associations (e.g. 'The Welsh Fisherman's Association', 'The Scottish Fishermen's Association' and the 'New Under Ten Fishermen's Association' (NUTFA)). Whilst it is identified that this project has relevance to these groups, the PI will engage with these male dominated groups sensitively as the findings of this project may not always represent their primary interests. At the same time, some of these groups have expressed interest and support of this project through participating in the project Steering Group (e.g. NUTFA). Therefore, to achieve impact within this group, the researcher will engage key individuals sympathetic to supporting women in UK fisheries and support them in broadening awareness within their, perhaps less sympathetic, fishing circles.
 
4. National policy representatives and organisations (e.g. Marine Management Organisation (MMO), Marine Scotland, Natural Resources Wales, Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Northern Ireland), and the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra, England); Seafish): The research will re-frame debates around what support is needed for achieving a more socio-economically sustainable small-scale fishing industry by contributing much needed 'holistic' evidence on how fishing families are responding to change. By addressing this gap in knowledge, key sources of resilience will be identified which is much needed and helpful knowledge for those seeking to manage fisheries for a better future. In addition, the research will engage with the perspective of these organisations (Phase II) to be able to suggest specific measures that these organisations could take to improve the position of women in a post-Brexit fishing industry.

The specific activities that will be organised to maximise the impacts of the research will be outlined in 'Pathways to Impact'.","Madeleine Gustavsson","Human Geography","Human Geography (General)","Rural Geography","Social Geography",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Economists have become increasingly interested in understanding the formation of networks and their implications for the economy. For example, the 2007-09 financial crisis starkly illustrated that the implications of both intra and inter-economy networks can be profound as contagion swept through the US banking market and global economies as a whole. The crisis clearly demonstrated the perils of treating cross-sectional economic agents, such as banks, as independent of each other. The aim of this project is to develop tools and methods that will help practitioners and academics to do valid inference in settings where the data are dependent across individual units and flexibility is permitted in the exact form of the economic relationship assumed.

Analysis of economic data with network dependence is different from that of dependent `time series' data. Time series are observed at chronological points and thus can be ordered in a natural fashion. A basis for modelling is by assuming forms of dependence that allow observations to be determined partially by past values. However, networks are formed by 'cross sectional' units and cannot generally be ordered in this way. Information on locations of observations may also be unavailable. Thus, specialised models and approaches are required that can handle these problems.

While there is an active econometric literature dealing with network dependent data, the toolkit available for practitioners facing such data sets is no match for that when handling independent data. This lacuna is even more acute when one considers the problem of inference in a nonparametric framework, in which one allows the data to learn the form of the relationship between economic variables, rather than impose a particular form. The cost of the generality of nonparametric methods is the requirement of a larger volume of data than parametric methods to achieve similar levels of performance. However, very large, even huge, data sets are a feature of modern applied econometrics and increase the appeal of nonparametric methods. Furthermore, in the age of `big data' practitioners must remain open-minded about choice of model as they gain access to larger data sets, and thus even the traditional parametric approach should be relaxed to permit models to become more complex as sample size increases, as the project proposes.

The project will recognize and develop a link between the modern econometric literature in partial identification and nonparametric network analysis. Specifically, partial identification occurs when the object of interest can only be distinguished within a certain set of `correct' objects, and not as a single unique object. On the other hand, a nonparametric object called `graphon' has been devised to parsimoniously capture the properties of a network. Graphons, however, are only partially identified, and the project proposes to develop a link between them and the econometric partial identification literature. For example, testing if two graphons are equal can be viewed as test for the 'equality' of the underlying networks.

Rigorous theory for the methods proposed to deal with the questions summarised above will be developed. Once the methods are theoretically justified, their properties will be examined in simulation studies and illustrated with applications to real data. Computer packages will be made available to help practitioners further in using the methods proposed in the most efficient way possible. In addition to academics, these practitioners would include professional economists in international organisations as well as researchers in companies with access to large, connected data sets.","Networks of economic agents, for instance financial institutions connected by common exposures to risks, are a distinctive feature of modern economies. This project aims to develop tools and methods that are valid when such agents are connected through networks and apply these to data sets to gain insight into the effect of networks on the real economy. The research produced during the project is anticipated to have impact beyond the university-based researchers discussed in the academic beneficiaries. We now outline these beneficiaries together with how they will benefit.

Researchers in central banks are interested in the implications of networks for their work, as are those based in the research wings of treasuries and the US Federal Reserve boards. The applicant has had a personal meeting with Raghuram Rajan, at the time the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (India's central bank), who expressed the desire to see such advances percolate to the systemic risk and financial stability analysis team at the bank. This is no doubt applicable to central banks globally. Researchers at international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development are also expected to have a strong interest in the results of the project.

Little is known empirically about the effect of financial networks on the real economy, and one reason for this is a lack of appropriate tools. This project will address this missing link. Central banks will be able to use the research produced by this project to conduct more accurate inferences on the real economy, as well as gain insight on spillovers via financial networks, e.g. in credit markets. Both aspects are important from a policy perspective and will generate impacts. The applicant is a fellow of the Essex Centre for Macroeconometrics and Financial Econometrics, which has strong links with central banks via the Bank of England (Profs Simon Price and Martin Weale), the Bank of Italy (Dr Fabio Busetti) and the Bank of Portugal (Dr Paulo Rodrigues). The applicant also has contacts at the IMF, and various central banks (Bundesbank, Chile, Thailand) which will help to maximize impact.

Interest in the work on graphons (scalar nonparametric objects that characterise network structure) will come also from industry. The initial development of graphons is in part due to research teams based in Microsoft, while many online retailers (eg Amazon) either employ specialist network analysis teams or enlist the services of companies that provide such skills (eg Qubit). This stakeholder group will be engaged through workshops with industry participants, eg those conducted by the Institute for Analytics and Data Science at Essex, UCL Big Data Institute and the Alan Turing Institute. Publishers are interested in more sophisticated network analysis, given their interest in citation networks. The PI has links with Mendeley that will be used to generate impacts. Aviation companies, airports and aviation consultants also have access to network data sets relating to passenger flows that they wish to analyse better. This can lead to substantial cost-savings through more efficient routes, e.g. by determining the impact of a change in a given city on passenger flows to and from that city and other cities. Such companies frequently employ PhD researchers for whom the research conducted is accessible. The PI has contacts with links to Airbus, while the university has contacts at Southend Airport through a commercial liaison wing. Both will be followed up to create impact.

Long-term impact will be ensured via the one-day workshop at the end of the grant period, which will bring together a range of academic and industrial delegates and seeks to create an 'impact legacy', as well as via open access software packages and routines to ensure that beneficiaries are able to use the methods developed easily, thereby increasing impact.","Abhimanyu Gupta","Economics","Econometrics",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

At the same time, there is an increasing recognition that regions play a central role in national development, and there are mounting pressures on regions' ability to independently strategise and interconnect globally. These trends are particularly visible in the redistribution of power and funding from national to local government currently occurring through the so-called devolution deals, and through the emergence of Local Enterprise Partnerships that since 2010 have succeeded Regional Development Agencies.

The renaissance of industry and manufacturing and the recognition that industry plays a central role in job creation, growth, and regions' economic recovery is also a priority in the policy agenda, with the 'Northern Powerhouse' strategy dominating the political lexicon, and setting the ambition to deliver business and enterprise growth with economic benefits for local communities.

However, without adequate technology foresight and the identification of emergent technologies that may lead to innovations in practice, industrial manufacturing regions face the challenge of industrial stagnation and the threats of global outsourcing. Therefore, it is critical for regions to overcome the debilitating problem of poor innovation capabilities reinforced by the frequent overspecialisation of the knowledge infrastructure in these areas. It is also necessary to identify the technology enablers that may lead to opportunities for development and growth: the upgrading or revitalisation of businesses; the development of new business activities in areas related to the existing industries; or new industries based in new technologies. 

Focusing on Sheffield City Region as an internationally recognised manufacturing hub, and on the Advance Manufacturing and Materials sector, this project will generate new knowledge and procedural solutions to the extremely important issue relating to the enhancement of a region's ability to identify and exploit knowledge of technological innovations, in order to maximise competitiveness and sustainability. 

Working closely with firms, local enterprise partnerships, policy makers and innovation experts, the project focuses on the understanding and development of concrete regional practices and processes for identifying, transferring and integrating technological innovations. This set of practices and processes includes the identification of relevant emergent technologies, the production of visions concerning their applicability (e.g. ability to generate product, processes or business innovations), and the contextualisation and application of the knowledge produced (brokerage activities) to allow exploitation and use in practice by firms.","Technology foresight is a critical component in the development of industrial strategy. It offers a promising new lens to address the challenge of regional growth. It holds the potential to help regions identify, absorb and exploit a variety of technological innovations that can drive transformation across UK manufacturing. On a practical level, the project outcomes are focused on strengthening regional knowledge assets, internal and external linkages and the dynamics of entrepreneurial environment within regions. The project contributes concrete regional practices and processes of identifying, transferring and integrating technological innovations. The results of the project will be highly valuable to city governors, chambers of commerce and industry, and firms that are interested and involved both in technology management and regional innovation systems policy and practice.

More specifically, the project will:

* Develop of a process for strategic intelligence through identifying technology innovation sources, building links across sources, and improving accessibility to technology. This will benefit Innovate UK strategy for business innovation and their focus on stimulating emerging technologies, particularly in the fields of advanced materials and advanced manufacturing, nanotechnology, electrical systems, etc.;
* Develop regional knowledge transfer and collective learning mechanisms to facilitate foresight, particularly in collaboration with UK Local Enterprise Partnerships;
* Articulate regional information brokerage structures and activities required to translate technology foresight into the development of new products, services and processes.

Specific impact-related mechanisms include:

* An Advisory Board, whose membership includes a variety of experts in regional development, manufacturing and knowledge transfer, who are at the same time beneficiaries of the research (Innovate UK, Confederation of British Industry, Sheffield City Region Growth Hub, Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre, etc.);
* A Policy Learning Lab bringing together communities of like-minded policymakers, practitioners and experts working to improve the Sheffield City Region development;
* A Workshop to increase exploitation of emerging enabling technologies, which provide the basis for innovation in a wide range of industries;
* A Peer to Peer event to provide firms, innovation experts, policy makers, R&amp;D centres with an opportunity to cross-fertilise practice, explore the potential to combine emerging technologies as a means to foster innovation, create new markets, and strengthen collaboration between different companies and stakeholders along the value chain; 
* An end of project workshop - bringing together Northern Powerhouse Local Enterprise Partnerships, advanced manufacturing firms, City Councils, Innovate UK, Confederation of British Industry, and policy makers - to promote takeover and adaptation of the action-oriented regional technology foresight framework.
* A project website to publicise work and allow for interaction with external actors on the findings;

From acute epidemics to slower onset issues such as antibiotic resistance, the world is facing a resurgence of infectious disease challenges. Far from being a thing of the past, these diseases have the potential to spread extensively in densely populated urban settings and to 'go global'. A major implication emerging from crises like Ebola (2014-15) and Zika (2015-16) is that dramatic inequities and pockets of severe neglect in public health standards leave us all vulnerable. Though their burdens fall most acutely on the poor, they also increase the potential for unmanageable crises with broader demographic impacts. Of particular concern are rapidly growing urban settlements which have played a role in exacerbating recent epidemics and where sanitary conditions pose an increasingly intractable challenge to health and development in many cities across the world.

The majority of the world's population already live in urban environments and numbers are predicted to rise dramatically. A large and growing proportion of these urban residents live in informal slum-like settlements. We know very little about how health systems are organised in these rapidly changing contexts, except that they are highly informal and old rules and approaches do not apply. The Ebola epidemic in particular revealed glaring gaps in evidence and understanding of these environments and populations, with fatal consequences. Indeed, it revealed there were pervasive misunderstandings and misrepresentations in policy circles which make interventions for both epidemic control and for basic public health difficult. Yet Ebola has also created a window of opportunity, both to understand the health challenges in informal settlements better and as the impetus to do things differently. 

This research will focus on health in informal settlements in Freetown, Sierra Leone, in the aftermath of Ebola. It will explore if and how such a major epidemic is changing the game and what lessons can be drawn for other contexts. To be able to know this we need a much deeper understanding of the social, political and economic relationships which surround urban health systems and which will determine the opportunities for change. Although aspects of the political and social determinants of urban health have been broadly characterized, less is known about the logics and practices of health in informal settlements from the perspectives and experiences of local community members - for example urban residents' own understandings of transmission, or socially embedded hygiene practices. It is equally unclear how such local norms and practices do or do not connect to policy understandings of these contexts, and to what effect. As such, the objectives of this research project are: 

1. To elucidate the social and political processes and practices of health systems and disease control in informal urban settlements, as represented and experienced by different actors, using ethnographic and participatory methods to understand and incorporate residents' own perspectives and practices; 
2. To identify institutional arrangements emerging in Sierra Leone post-Ebola which have the potential for improving or worsening health in informal urban settlements;
3. To contribute to health systems strengthening and to epidemic preparedness and control in urban areas by integrating perspectives from medical anthropology, urban studies, and public health.

The project will be a collaboration between a UK anthropologist with over 7 years' experience in Sierra Leone and a new urban research centre based in Freetown. The combination of in-country experience and local partnerships provides a unique platform to develop cutting edge perspectives on urban health, informed by a deep understanding of the city and of global health politics and practice.","This research aims to improve the health of people living in informal urban settlements. The residents of these settlements face particularly high disease burdens and are vulnerable to infectious disease epidemics. They are also frequently stigmatised, ignored or misunderstood by policy makers and other members of society. The Ebola epidemic brought many of these issues to the fore and has created an opportunity to learn from and about them and bring about positive changes, which this research will actively contribute to. Beneficiaries of this research are 
 a) the residents of informal urban settlements in Freetown, Sierra Leone, and indirectly those further afield too 
 b) policy makers and people working in sectors relevant to urban health in Sierra Leone 
 c) researchers working on urbanisation, public health and health systems and 
 d) the wider global health community working on issues of strengthening health systems.

For the residents themselves, the research will produce practical insights into institutional arrangements that can improve their health and health systems in their settlements. It will address incorrect assumptions about their behaviours and practices and highlight what actions they are already taking which could be supported. 

The project's participatory methods will provide a platform to co-produce improvements in urban health between the residents of Freetown's informal settlements and policy makers and practitioners, including civil society organisations, local NGOs, and city officials (e.g. in the Mayor's office) and other government policy makers (e.g. in the Ministry of Health and Sanitation). The use of foresight with these groups will foster integrated multi-stakeholder and multi-sectoral planning for urban health. Each group will be able to clarify their priorities and perspectives, which, in addition to the activities in the Impact Plan (see Pathways to Impact), will result in enhanced understandings and integration of diverse perspectives on infection control. This will enable more nuanced and locally sensitive policies to address health related shocks and challenges, and increased trust. 

Both researchers and members of the wider global health community will benefit from new inter-disciplinary networks and collaborations across the fields of medical anthropology, urban studies, and public health. For researchers working on urbanisation and health systems the research will synthesise perspectives in medical anthropology and urban studies which will offer new theoretical and empirical understandings of the relationships between power, knowledge, informality and visibility in urban health. This new synthesis, which will be rooted in ethnographic understandings of social and political histories, processes and practices, will deepen systems and resilience thinking. It will contribute practically to approaches to health systems strengthening policies and to ensuring that positive lessons are learned and supported from the Ebola epidemic.","Ann Wilkinson","Area Studies","Development studies","Social Anthropology","African Studies","Anthropology and Development","Development studies","Global Health and Medicine","Social Anthropology",NA

What political and economic mechanisms support international economic orders, and the hollowing out of such orders? Who wins and who loses when international regimes breakdown?

Historical parallels are commonly drawn between the current popular backlash against globalisation and the international politics and economics of the 1930s. However, the disintegration of the Sterling Area after 1945, a long-forgotten historical remnant of British economic imperialism, may be more instructive as the world faces the prospect of American economic decline and a fraying EU economic regime.

The Sterling Area, a group of countries bound to Britain through the deep historical, political and economic ties, remained after WWII, &quot;the largest multilateral trading system in the world&quot; (Shannon 1949). But the system was slowly declining even then and definitively came apart in the 1970s. This study is the first to quantitatively survey the dissolution of the economic bloc as it played out in Britain and across member countries. This history can help us to recognize and better understand the dynamics of international economic disintegration and realignment.

In the early post-war period, Sterling Area participants vigorously debated their relative burdens as well as the benefits of ongoing membership (e.g. Conan 1952; Day 1954). But later observers focused on the system's effects on the British domestic economy and on the international monetary order at large (e.g. Cohen 1971, Schenk 2010). The mounting burdens on the bloc's individual participants that drove them to leave the system have been neglected. Moreover, there has never been a systematic study of how discriminatory international trade policies and economic patterns evolved in this transitional era. We need to understand how the choices of states affected international monetary and trading outcomes, if they are to help us navigate today's dynamics of dissolution and realignment.

And choices there were. While particulars differed, most countries enjoyed some autonomy in making trade and exchange-rate policies. Further, most industries could decide between adapting to the shifting global economic environment or else defending their Sterling Area markets. The key political and economic choices were structured through a loosely coupled set of specific interacting regimes, including the Sterling Area, US-dollar area, European Payments Union, a network of bilateral agreements, and multilateral arrangements under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and Bretton Woods institutions.

In this fragmented world economy that mirrors today's, countries evaluated trade-offs between the benefits of the Sterling Area discrimination and those of liberalisation, including closer economic ties with America and Europe. With new data and mixed method techniques, we can evaluate why states made the choices they did in this context and consider the implications for economic performance and outcomes.

The breakdown of the Sterling Area has been studied before (e.g. Schenk 1994; Strange 1971). But our re-evaluation takes seriously variables that have been ignored in the past, such as the international political and institutional factors that structured state behaviour, market performance within the system and connections with other parts of the world economy. We will also tackle a uniquely comprehensive range of influences, considering the impact of the system on member exit decisions, British trade performance, and the adaptive strategies pursued by policymakers.

More complete research is useful to those grappling with today's international realignments. By focusing on the right data, we hope to show that the post-WWII world economy can shed light on issues such as the decline of the US dollar, Brexit, and mounting protectionism in global trade.","Academic impact: The study will follow a clear academic dissemination plan designed to reach an international interdisciplinary audience. The study will produce four research articles.

At the end of the project, the PI and CI will prepare a book proposal to be completed after the funded period. We will also seek to publish the papers written for the Queen's methods workshop and the Howard Marks Chair lecture series and workshops as Special Issues and collected volumes.

Policy impact: Better understanding of the politics of economic disintegration is important to policymakers and business practitioners confronted with nationalist risks to regional economic orders deemed crucial by some to national prosperity and commercial success. A key ambition of the project is to provide solid evidence and analytical insights for the policymaking process. What are the best models for managing disintegrative pressures? What are the political and economic consequences of different responses? Policymakers and business leaders should think carefully about these questions, and this project will help them do so. 

To this end, we have fostered links with the Institute for Government, Chatham House's International Economics Department, the Centre for European Policy Studies, Eurofi. We will also share findings with the Political Economy of Financial Markets and Global Economic Governance Programs in Oxford and the Lauder Institute and Perry World House Center at the University of Pennsylvania.

Public discourse and media: A variety of publishers may be interested in reviewing the outputs of the project or citing it for expert analysis. Serious engagement with the research can be expected from the Economist and Financial Times, in particular its Future of Britain Project. Given Brexit and popular backlash against NAFTA and other institutional foundations of liberal globalisation, the forces of economic disintegration are front and centre in current affairs. Our work can help publics grappling with difficult questions and competing claims about disintegration. The dominant narratives of industrialists, financiers, and politicians, on all sides of the argument, often appeal to history, in particular in the case of Brexit where advocates highlight potential Commonwealth relationships. Our research will provide an objective benchmark against which to evaluate these historical associations and the choices before publics.

Education and culture: The project will have educational and cultural impact well beyond its relevance to current events. Queen's University will provide central support for one leveraged PhD studentship between 2018 and 2021 in conjunction with the project. In connection with the University of Pennsylvania knowledge exchange, we shall arrange a multi-presenter, high-profile lecture series on global economic order management and production. The series will be hosted at the Lauder Institute in partnership with the Perry World House Center and made available online. To interject in cultural debates and projects, we will engage the Institute for Commonwealth Studies and the British Documents on the End of Empire Project (BDEEP). We will also make a poster for Commonwealth museums.

Research clusters and networks: The project will speak to issues of global importance, involving collaborators and partnerships across the world, presentations in North America and Europe, a new UK-based research cluster, and an invaluable network created through the Howard Marks Chair in Economic History at the University of Pennsylvania.","Alan de Bromhead","Economics","History","Pol. sci. & internat. studies","Economic & Social History","Internat Political Economy","International economics",NA,NA,NA

Numbers stations can appear on shortwave frequencies without warning, announcing themselves with a musical tone, followed by a ream of seemingly random numbers and words read out by an automated voice, often accompanied by indecipherable noises, before disappearing as suddenly as they came. Despite existing for decades worldwide, there has been next to no research on these broadcasts.

The project will examine numbers stations as an example of a covert state practice that crosses over into the public sphere, that leaves traces in its wake, in the form of broadcasts that can be picked up on a radio by anyone. There is a growing literature on the ways in which state secrecy does not simply remove things from the public sphere by covering them up, but can itself become part of the public sphere. Acts of keeping things secret can leave a public mark: from an official's refusal to confirm or deny a story, to the black ink of a redacted sentence. These marks reflect the use of secrecy to project state power, but can also have political effects in excess of state intentions - redactions in a torture investigation can imply unsavoury practices that the state would rather hide.

In the past, traces of secrecy have been understood primarily as speech acts or as material visible phenomena: the fences surrounding a military base, or the carefully chosen words of a politician. By contrast, this research will investigate secrecy that operates through sound, both vocal and non-vocal. Numbers station broadcasts are sounds that produce secrecy as something aural in the public sphere. These radio frequencies allow states to carry out secret practices, while the sonic qualities of the broadcasts - from their robotic voices, to radio silence and static - ascribe characteristics to that secrecy, just as the words or redactions of a government can imply different things about their attempts to hide things. These sounds can represent secrecy, moreover, in ways that exceed state intentions. This process is also shaped by how sounds are accessed; state secrecy is shaped not just by numbers station broadcasts, but by the act of 'tapping into' these stations. As traces of state practices, these broadcasts also manifest the state as a covert actor, heard but not seen, and encourage particular understandings of the state that carry political consequences.

Numbers stations offer a unique opportunity to explore how state secrecy exists aurally, in ways that go beyond visual understandings of secrecy as that which hides or makes invisible. These broadcasts open up space for considering the conceptual links between sound and secrecy: the ways in which sound is both a novel resource for states to practice secrecy, and a material that broadens our ideas of how secrecy exists in, and impacts on, the public sphere.

This project will therefore document how numbers station broadcasts reproduce the state and secrecy in public, and will use this analysis to rethink state secrecy in terms of sound. To complete these objectives, this project will first examine the known history and geography of numbers stations, and what this tells us about states' covert operations; second, carry out field recordings of radio frequencies used by numbers stations, to analyse how these broadcasts and their interception reproduce state secrecy in public space; and third, analyse recordings of these broadcasts on internet archives, to understand how sonic secrecy implicitly shapes the meaning attached to states' covert activities. Out of this, the project will produce academic and magazine writings on how state secrecy shapes public life, and a website that makes the research findings accessible to the public and relates the research to current debates around state secrecy and covert practices.","The research will have three main groups of users and beneficiaries. The first is civil society activists and organisations, primarily based in Europe and the United States, focused on issues of state secrecy. Over the past decade, public interest in the use of secrecy by Western liberal states for security purposes has increased, due to revelations of surveillance and spying, and the shift towards covert counter-terrorism. Activists and organisations have scrutinised the use of this secrecy and its potential political effects, both on states' ability to conduct unaccountable action and on public understandings of their governments and of international relations. Organisations such as the Remote Control Project and Statewatch have tried to document the use of state secrecy and to analyse the possible contents of those secrets, while individual activists have discussed the implications of these developments in publications including New Internationalist and Open Democracy.

The research will greatly benefit these civil society groups in two ways. First, the research results will demonstrate how covert practices can be documented and analysed, not despite, but precisely because of states' attempts to prevent public scrutiny of its policies. The research will provide methodological tools that overcome the view of secrecy as a barrier to analysis, by using the act of secrecy itself as a data source, analysing how that act manifests in the public sphere in ways beyond states' control, and what it reveals about the political power of secrecy. Second, the research will offer a new way of thinking about what secrecy is and how it operates in public life, by re-conceptualising secrecy through its relationship to sound.

The second beneficiary is the general newsreading public, primarily in Britain and the United States but also more generally in Western liberal democratic states. Media studies scholarship has concluded that citizens of these states are significantly ill-informed about their governments' covert actions and policies (eg. Moorehead et al 2017). News coverage often inaccurately reports on available information, or is too sparse and speculative to benefit public knowledge. The secrecy which surrounds covert operations, moreover, is treated simplistically in news analysis, which rarely considers the effects of secrecy itself on geopolitics and on public understandings.

The research and its outputs will benefit the newsreading public by demonstrating how secrecy does not simply restrict public knowledge, but shapes public representations of the state and its activities. Both the numbers station research and the PI's previous analysis of covert counter-terrorism will be used in research outputs as examples of how secrecy has political effects in the public sphere. The research will thereby provide this constituency with evidence of how state secrecy can affect political debate and understandings in often inconspicuous ways, regardless of the level of public knowledge of those secrets' contents, and how this potential effect can be identified. The research will also offer an alternative political position on state secrecy, beyond the current binary choice between uncritical acceptance of states' justifications for secrecy and conspiracy theorising.

Finally, the research will benefit amateur radio enthusiast communities who gather information and recordings of numbers stations broadcasts but who are unable to discern these broadcasts' content or purpose. By placing this group's work in an historical and political context, the research will encourage this constituency to consider numbers stations in terms of how state secrecy impacts the public sphere, including through this group's own archiving work. The research will also provide this group with methodological tools to gain more knowledge from their recordings, and conceptual tools to understand why these opaque broadcasts may provoke such intense amateur interest.","Oliver Kearns","Human Geography","Pol. sci. & internat. studies","Internat.

Breathing polluted air can cause lung problems or make them worse. It is estimated that millions of people worldwide suffer from asthma. Yet, it is difficult to define what air pollution is, or identify exactly what its effects on health are. Across the world, there therefore many studies addressing pollution. They use different ways of trying to gather information about pollution. This project is about an air pollution study in Delhi, India, where there are high levels of pollution, and high levels of lung problems, particularly for young people. The air pollution study involves a new technology: sensors which can be worn on the body to measure pollution. Young people aged between 16 and 18 who have asthma will be wearing these sensors, and scientists will be studying the findings from the sensors to find out how air pollution is different in different places and changes over time. This proposed project involves working with the young people and the scientists from the air pollution study. It will look at how this research is making new ways of understanding the health effects of exposure to air pollution. The project will look at what it is like to wear these sensors, and how scientists use the information they provide. To do this, we will talk to the young people, and walk around the city with them as they are wearing the sensors. We will also interview the scientists, and observe how they do the research and what they do with the results. We will also use group workshops. These will explore how young people with asthma who wear these bodily-worn sensors understand, experience and contribute to scientific knowledge about air pollution and health. Studying how participants in this research use these personal sensors will provide knowledge about the social contexts of exposure and the way in which air pollution is seen (or not) as affecting health. The research will also raise awareness of the potential societal and ethical challenges of involving people in research about air pollution. The research aims to contribute to air pollution research involving personal sensors by examining how these may help us better understand the health effects of exposure, but also the potential risks and ethical problems that may arise as a result. This will be achieved by: i) Conducting interviews and walking interviews around Delhi with young people with asthma wearing the air pollution sensors on their body. ii) Drawing maps with some of the young people with asthma to understand how they manage their asthma as they move around the city. iii) To study how the young adults participating in the scientific research and scientists conducting the research interact and communicate. iv) Examine how the research in Delhi can be used to understand air pollution in other cities around the world. v) Share the findings from the interviews with the young adults with the scientists using these sensors in their research to consider their social and ethical implications. vi) Present the drawn maps by the young adults with asthma in exhibitions open to the public in London and Delhi. The research findings of this project will contribute to the development of policies that can help reduce exposure to air pollution and improve health. There is currently little knowledge about the ways in which some people are exposed to different levels of air pollution and therefore at higher risk of health problems. What is known, however, is that some people are more at risk to air pollution than others. This means the health effects of air pollution are not equally shared by society. Generating knowledge about how people use cities and why some people may be more at risk to pollution than others is urgently needed if we are going to help build cities that protect their citizens' health now and in the future.","This proposed research will have economic and social benefits by addressing three major themes in contemporary environmental health research and policy: (1) Increasing the effectiveness of public services and policy in improving air quality; (2) Improve public understanding of science by generating publicly relevant scientific evidence; (3) Develop effective interdisciplinary and academic-non-academic partnerships and thereby knowledge exchange to improve the economic competitiveness of the UK. How this latter point is achieved in practice is valuable for future research and pragmatic interventions on this key topic of concern. Improving urban air quality cannot be resolved solely through technocratic solutions. A socially and contextually relevant understanding is required if we are going to make feasible changes to environmental health and make ethically informed, responsible changes to people's lives. This project will contribute to these areas by targeting three different beneficiaries: (1) public services and policy makers;(2) young adults in Delhi and London; the general public; educational and health practitioners. (3) Academic and non-academic partnerships in UK and India; public and policy engagement in academic research. In terms of the first beneficiary (1), the research findings will have direct relevance to national and municipal level policy on air pollution. By providing specific findings about air pollution at the individual and community level, the research can inform policy in the study country and therefore develop strategies to effectively respond to these needs. Mitigation strategies will be creatively explored stakeholder engagement workshops that bring government officials, local authorities and public health practitioners into dialogue. To ensure the research has societal benefit, at the scale of individual and community health, (2) creative capacity building activities will be carried out through the project's duration. Impact will be achieved through methods of co-production, allowing young adults to participate in the social science study to feed back into the research process and shape its findings. Understanding how scientific data are made and personal sensors work will also potentially have longer-term benefits; providing young people with the necessary skills and resources as urban citizens to hold governments to account. The outputs generated will also be displayed to the public in a series of public-facing installations to increase audience reach. The research will also be accessible via the project website and various social media outlets managed by the PI. Finally, (3) the inherently collaborative and interdisciplinary nature of &quot;sensing bodies&quot; anticipates the building of longer-term partnerships between academic, non-academic and artistic institutions, organisations and individuals in the UK and India. How to achieve effective partnerships will also be explored through evaluation of the various impact activities. Evaluating impact activities will be valuable to the translation of future research on this key topic and other intractable public health challenges. This will include the use of questionnaires to generate quantitative and qualitative data on the effectiveness of impact activities, as well as more reflective documenting of based on the experiences of those leading the events. This evaluative work will ensure the research progresses in a way that further develops the methodological design of the project and therefore it's future impact potential. The impact evaluation will be disseminated in presentations and publications of the research because impact activities are taking place throughout the research process, rather than as an endpoint. Harnessing an already existing network of interdisciplinary researchers means the project's outputs will be communicated to relevant science-policy stakeholders, as well as practitioners working on the front-line of urban public health.","Emma Garnett","Science and Technology Studies","Science and Technology Studies",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It can be defined as an enhancement in the ability to distinguish between similar stimuli (that otherwise would be very hard to tell apart) as a consequence of experience with them, or with stimuli similar to the target stimuli. The proposed project focuses on the development of this phenomenon as a key factor to our ability to recognise faces. Further, by using a range of neuroscience techniques (EEG/ERP, tDCS, fMRI, TMS) in conjunction with the behavioural designs I have developed, I will investigate methods to improve this perceptual skill and define specific brain structures responsible for the control and development of this phenomenon. So, basically, I aim to find out how we improve at telling things apart (discrimination) and to discover ways of enhancing this ability.

I will start by developing the case for perceptual learning as a key contributor to one of the most robust cognitive phenomenon in face recognition i.e. the composite face effect. This refers to individuals' decreased ability to recognise the top half of one face presented in composite with the bottom half of another face when the composite is upright and aligned than when the two halves are offset laterally (misalignment). By using novel categories of prototype-defined chequerboards which participants will be pre-exposed to during the study procedure, I would expect to show a similar composite effect for familiar chequerboards to that usually found with faces. This will be our index of perceptual learning.

The project will then continue by using different neurostimulation techniques (tDCS and TMS) to selectively increase and decrease the composite effect for chequerboards and that for faces. Through a combination of tDCS and EEG techniques, this project will also reveal how specific brain responses usually found for faces, can also be found for familiar chequerboards and be altered by neurostimulation. Finally, a combination of tDCS and fMRI will help to localise more precisely the brain structures involved in perceptual learning.

This project will provide us with insights into the mechanisms that characterise the development and control of perceptual learning and will extend perceptual learning to face recognition by showing how similar effects to those usually found for faces can be found for categories of stimuli that participants had never seen before entering the lab. It will also provide evidence for the neurocognitive basis of perceptual learning. We will use these results to devise methods of training that can enhance our discrimination abilities in various domains. It would allow us to tailor training programmes (e.g. involving stimuli such as faces, fingerprints, cervical smears, mammograms) to provide maximum benefit in terms of performance by the trainee. As an example, this research would be suitable for enhancing the face recognition skills of frontline and intelligence staff, and one might be able to selectively increase the effectiveness of this training through the use of mobile neuroscience techniques based on the Starstim EEG/tDCS system. It would also give us insights into how to design artificial systems for the detection and recognition of such stimuli, which would be of interest to companies specialised in computer software or apps for face recognition.","This new approach for studying the mechanisms of perceptual learning using a combination of experimental psychology designs and neuroscience techniques will benefit several academic and non-academic organisations within and outside the UK. 

It will create a database of advanced knowledge about perceptual learning that could serve several researchers as the basis for future research on human cognitive skills, neuroscience techniques, and the creation of computer software for discrimination and recognition of various stimuli (e.g. faces). This would, in turn, enable the PI and others to apply this body of knowledge to real-world problems such as face recognition both by humans (e.g. &quot;super recognisers&quot;) and by machines. To this end, the PI and the Co-I already have initial links to Dr Josh Davis' lab at the University of Greenwich where they work with the Metropolitan Police Force on super recognisers, and links with Prof. Dominic Dwyer's lab at Cardiff where they are investigating the application of models of human perceptual learning to machine recognition of images in conjunction with a number of industrial partners. 

Through the University of Exeter Impact Innovation &amp; Business (IIB) service and ESRC Impact Accelerator Account, the PI will seek to establish new collaborations with public and private organisations so as to maximise the societal impact of the findings produced by the proposed research. This could benefit government agencies such as Defence (DSTL), Customs and Excise (screening for contraband) and some medical applications (e.g. radiography). One example, contributing to the work done by DSTL, would be training the military, in discriminating similar targets in combat situations. An application that could be developed as a consequence of this programme of research would be one that selectively increases the effectiveness of this training through the use of mobile neuroscience techniques based on the Starstim EEG/tDCS system. As another example, it could also benefit private organisations like IBM in developing new computer and phone apps to provide face and object recognition skills for medical testing (e.g. detecting early signs of neurodegenerative disorders affecting face or object recognition). 

The PI will also attend the University of Exeter annual Research Focus Week event (2018-19-20) usually organised in May. Many of the sessions planned for this event, such as those on UK Government and Industry funding; EU funding, Engaged Research, Large Grants, Programme Grants and Centre Bids will allow the PI to discuss with the Exeter technical research staff and guest speakers further opportunities for him to use this research and so increase the impact of it within and outside the UK.

To engage with a wider public, the PI will present this research at the events organised by the University of Exeter that involve high-school students and their parents (National Science Week demonstrations and talks, School events). Also, he will present this research at research seminars within the Department of Psychology so that students from the different psychology domains within the department (social, clinical, cognitive and animal behaviour) can benefit from the research. The PI will also present this research at the Lecture and Research events organised by the University and open to the public.

Depositing the data and outputs from the proposed research on open access (through the Exeter ORE system) will ensure anybody from the public will be able to benefit from this research. The University Press Office will also help to extend my research findings to the public through the use of local, national and international newspapers, magazines, and online media.","Ciro Civile","Psychology","Cognitive Psychology","Experimental Psychology","Psychology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Engaging drug takers into the debate","Drug policy reform is high on the global political agenda. Since the turn of the 21st century, several countries have shifted from prohibition policy. Academics, policy-makers, practitioners, and non-government organisations (NGOs) are discussing (and advocating for) drug policy reform in the UK focussing on the usefulness and relevance of the Misuse of Drugs (MDA) Act 1971 and the Psychoactive Substances Act (PSA) 2016. Yet the voices of drug takers are largely absent from such debate and there is now increasing acknowledgement that contribution from drug takers is required to improve both the policy legitimacy and outcomes (UKDPC, 2012; Lancaster et al., 2014; Lancaster et al, 2015). The proposed research builds on two research projects conducted by the PI that interviewed 60 drug takers. Interviewees from both projects were asked for their opinions on drug policy and the law. Most drug takers were unable to distinguish between different policy approaches and were unclear about the definitions of, 'legalisation', 'regulation' and 'decriminalisation. For example, most were aware that Portugal decriminalised drugs in 2001, but they needed further clarification about what this meant in practice. This research aims to actively involve various drug takers into the drug policy debate by educating them about alternative policy approaches and engaging them in workshop discussions. More investigation is required to understand drug takers' views on policy (specifically on the current prohibitionist framework and alternative models, such as decriminalisation, medicalisation and regulation), how these opinions are formulated and what components of drug policy are important to drug takers. Through the inclusion and analysis of drug takers' experiences and opinions, a drug policy action plan will be formulated. This is necessary to make policy debates more inclusive and facilitate a space to better connect policy to those that it affects. 

The project has 3 dualistic aims that both empower stigmatised groups (drug takers), whilst improving debates about drug policy reform 

1: Improve debates about drug policy reform by involving drug takers' experiences and opinions
2: Create a drug action plan using the 'discursive democracy' approach with a range of drug takers 
3: Share the findings of the research to key stakeholders to facilitate future interactions about drug policy development 

These will be achieved through 5 practical objectives:
Ob1: Capture the level of drug-takers' knowledge and opinions of law and policy and establish how these opinions have been formulated by undertaking a baseline survey.
Ob2: Develop an educational video to outline different policy approaches to improve drug takers' knowledge and understanding. 
Ob3: Co-ordinate workshops using 'discursive democracy' to generate qualitative data revealing drug-taker's opinions of current and alternative policy and actively encourage their participation in debate.
Ob4: Use the findings of the survey and workshops to formulate a comprehensive and informed drug policy action plan.
Ob5: Disseminate the drug policy action plan through academic conferences and peer-reviewed articles, and through relevant drug policy NGOs who engage and interact with policy-makers.

The potential applications and benefits are to:

1. Broaden the debates about UK drug policy reform to include a wide range of people who are directly affected by drug law and policy.

2. Help inform, educate and empower the public about political issues, in this instance drug policy.

3. Contribute to broader debates about the opportunities and potential for drug policy reform both nationally and globally.

4. Provide NGOs with academic research that can be used for evidence and lobbying to policy makers and government.

5. The video explaining current and alternative drug policy approaches could be used to educate the general public.","This project is specifically intended to provide research findings and evidence with a view to informing and improving the UK's drug policy and legislation. As such, it has potential for impact on a number of key beneficiary groups:
Policy makers: Policy makers will gain from a wider evidence base and a greater understanding of how the law and policy effects drug users and the public and what their perceptions are about opportunities for reform. This will open up new and possibly challenging areas for debate, which incorporate a broader range of opinions, more contemporary perspectives and evidence linked to genuine user experiences. Policy makers will be engaged with via a stakeholder event and the production of the Drug Policy Action Plan containing specific recommendations. 
NGOs: NGOs such as the Beckley Foundation, Release and Volteface are discussing (and advocating for) drug policy reform in the UK focussing on the usefulness and relevance of the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA) 1971 and the Psychoactive Substances Act (PSA) 2016. NGOs and lobbyists will gain a greater understanding of drug takers' opinions and experiences and will be able to use this information to lobby government and the media. NGOs will also be able to use the educational video outlining various drug policy models within their organisations. By disseminating our findings to NGOs, the research can facilitate dialogue for future interactions between drug takers and policy.
Drug users: Through integrating drug taker participation into drug policy debates, those directly affected by policy will have the opportunity to have their opinions and experiences taken into consideration. Drug takers will be empowered by further education about different policy approaches and have a greater understanding about their own views about opportunities for reform. Providing drug takers with a platform to have their voices heard will help to reduce stigma and discrimination. There is currently no UK research that is engaging drug takers into policy debate and therefore this research will be instrumental in demonstrating the usefulness, as well as the challenges, of their inclusion. 
Public engagement: Promotion of broader public engagement into drug policy debates will further educate and involve citizens into policy and politics. The educational video and the discursive democracy workshops could be used by various groups and organisations to gain a better understanding of views about drug policy. The discursive democracy approach could also be used to improve the connection between academia and the public more generally. It could be used in a variety of policy debates, such as prison policy reform or Britain's place in the European Union. 
We have developed five 'Impact Objectives':
IO1: Promote and facilitate drug taker participation into drug policy debates in order to engage with those directly affected by policy.
IO2: Provide drug takers with information on current laws and alternative policy models for their education and to ascertain what their perspectives on these policies are.
IO3: Stimulate broader public engagement in drug policy debates to further educate and widen the range of citizens' input to policy decisions.
IO4: Contribute to the work of NGOs active in the drug policy field through collaboration and the provision of new evidence.
IO5: Provide policy makers with the currently unavailable evidence required to strengthen drug policy legitimacy and outcomes.
IO6: Develop and share a set of recommendations and actions in the form of a Drug Policy Action Plan.","Rebecca Askew","Law & legal studies","Pol. sci. & internat. studies","Sociology","Criminal Law & Criminology","Criminology","Cultural Studies","Human Rights","Political Science",NA

The supply of generated electricity must match demand at all times otherwise there will be rolling blackouts. If local authorities do not centralise primary school admissions, many parents would be pressured into accepting places in schools where their children would not thrive. If the government gives away mobile spectrum licenses for free, then spectrum might not end up with telecoms companies that can provide the best service for the public.

Many markets can be drastically improved using insights from a branch of economics called &quot;market design&quot;. Market designers use economic theory to develop market rules and create infrastructure that facilitates market transactions. Company shares, commodities, and even electricity are traded in organised exchanges. Centralized two-sided matching markets are used to match doctors to hospitals, children to schools and universities, one incompatible kidney donor-patient pair to another, and army cadets to branches of service. Auctions are used to find the most willing buyers for swathes of mobile spectrum, precious antiques, and search engine adverts. 

Market designers have created many ways to design markets that superbly allocate similar (identical or substitutable) items. These include auctions for antiques and preference-based matching systems used by local authorities to allocate children to primary schools. 

But one particular feature that drastically complicates the design of markets is complementarity. Things are complements when the value of them together is greater than the sum of their individual parts. 

Coming back to an example above, suppose that the government wanted to sell mobile spectrum licenses. Telecoms companies value nearby licenses a great deal as it allows them to provide a better service for customers. Should the government bundle nearby licenses together or sell them separately? Now suppose that in order to sell spectrum licenses to telecoms companies the government first has to buy these spectrum licenses from hundreds of television stations. Should the government buy and sell these licenses at the same time? Finally, suppose that the government could also move some television stations to broadcast on other parts of the spectrum. Which stations should it move while avoiding broadcast interference? Answering all these questions involves tackling different types of complementarity.

There are other examples of real-world markets with complementarities. Property developers bidding in a land auction often want to buy adjacent plots of land. Boat captains often want to exchange some of their fishing quota for quota of other species. In order to avoid blackouts, the electricity grid operator has to make sure that certain fossil fuel and renewable generators are producing energy at the same time.

These examples make clear that in the presence of complementarities market design can be crucial to ensure the market works well. Coordination is required to ensure that as many of the complementary transactions take place as possible. However, when there are complementarities, simple, classic auctions and matching algorithms can fail dramatically. Therefore new theoretical tools are needed.

In this work, I develop new theoretical and practical tools - auctions, matching markets, and trading networks - to design markets with different types of complementarity. I also test one new auction in a series of laboratory experiments. This work has a number of important applications for the redesign of many existing markets and for the design of new ones, including markets for biodiversity conservation, peer-to-peer energy trading, auctions and exchanges of fishing quota, and matching systems for the allocation of resettled refugees.","Every theoretical model developed in this research programme is inspired by, or is directly applicable to, designing real-world markets. Therefore, this research will have an impact on a number of beneficiaries outside academia. In the Pathways to Impact, I address specifically how I will engage and collaborate with these beneficiaries, disseminate my research, and establish opportunities for knowledge exchange.

Project 3 on matching markets with complementarities is directly related to an application of refugee resettlement. Several governments, including the United States, Canada, France, and the United Kingdom, resettle a total of around 100,000 refugees annually directly from refugee camps. These resettlement destinations lack tools to match refugee families to fitting local areas. In this research programme, I will not only develop better algorithms for existing resettlement models, but also link the matching system to financing of resettlement by governments and social impact investors. I am already working closely with one US resettlement agency to create such a matching system and I hope to apply these methods at other agencies and governments. This work also interests a number of foundations and non-governmental organisations, such as the Center for Global Development, Open Society Foundations, and Oxfam.

A key application of Project 1 (auctions with complements) in this research programme is environmental market design, in particular biodiversity conservation and investment in renewable natural resources. If a government agency (e.g. Defra or Natural England) or firms (e.g. Unilever) is interested in investing in biodiversity conservation or ecosystem service provision, they will often be interested in large swathes of land that can comprise many adjacent private properties. This is because natural ecosystems do not usually respect property boundaries but still must be protected as a whole. This work is also related to my involvement in a grant from The Nature Conservancy, an American environmental charity.

As more consumers begin to generate renewable electricity with solar panels and install batteries at home, there will be more intermediaries in the electricity market who are buying and selling electricity. In order to ease power line congestion and create a resilient energy system with a large fraction of renewables, electricity pricing will have to expand from a single market price to locational pricing and eventually to peer-to-peer pricing. I expect that both grid operators and peer-to-peer electricity start-ups will benefit of a new understanding of pricing in networks. These sorts of systems can be easily deployed on micro-grids which are becoming prevalent in rural areas of developing countries. I develop a new theory of networked market design to advance this application in Project 2.

Ideas developed in Project 1 and Project 2 will also benefit stakeholders and producer organisations in the fishing industry. Fishing quota is often allocated through auctions. Many fish species breed together so when fishermen target one fish species they inadvertently catch another species. Since fish discard is often prohibited, fishermen must buy quota for both types of fish making the quota for different species complementary. Another interesting application is an exchange of fishing quota after an auction. Boat captains buy an amount of quota for different species that is based on their projection of marine ecology. However, fishing can be highly unpredictable and once the net is cast and the catch is brought in, boat captains often need to trade quota of one species for another. Boat captains might want to sell some quota and buy quota for other species at the same time. I am already involved with designing fishing auctions in the Faroe Islands. I will explore complex quota auctions and quota exchanges with the Faroese, Scottish, and English fisheries managers based on the results of the research programme.","Alexander Teytelboym","Economics","Behavioural & experimental eco","Economics","Microeconomic theory","Public economics",NA,NA,NA,NA

Governments, aid agencies and foreign investors increasingly recognised the strategic importance of agriculture in driving growth and addressing poverty and hunger in Africa. Among those mobilised were public and private actors from Brazil, China and India. These countries are part of the rising powers in global development, whose presence in Africa spread quickly in the new century. They have offered finance, trade opportunities, loans and technical assistance, combined in a package that became known as South-South cooperation (SSC). Agricultural SSC includes not only private investments in farming land but also the transfer of technology, such as seeds and machinery, and know-how concerning agronomic research and farming practices. These countries claim to have much to offer to African countries struggling with challenges of hunger, food insecurity and low yields. After all, they had themselves successfully addressed these challenges back home through public investment in technological innovation that delivered unprecedented results in production and productivity, particularly in the 1960-80s. This chapter in these countries' history became known as the Green Revolution (GR).

Despite remarkable achievements, criticism to the GR is well established, particularly regarding the social distribution of benefits and negative environmental externalities. The GR remains therefore a disputed moment in the world's agricultural history. Yet, its celebration has gained impetus in recent years. In Africa, there have been calls for an African GR, reinforced by SSC. SSC providers emphasise their own successes and the suitability of their policies and technologies to other developing countries with parallel agro-climatic conditions and development challenges. Their cooperation initiatives have helped reviving the GR history and narratives of past transformations of heroic achievements. These narratives stress the technological dimension of the transformation and the role of scientists who, through innovation, dedication and hard-work, contributed to addressing the calamity of hunger. These 'epic narratives' are being used today to emphasise the role that science and technology (S&amp;T) from countries like Brazil, China and India can play in African agriculture today. So how do epic narratives of the GR currently shape current agricultural S&amp;T transfers into Africa?

This research will answer this question by looking comparatively at the GRs of Brazil, China and India. It will look at how these countries have made sense of their history - how epic narratives of the GR got established, evolved over time and across generations. It will then analyse how epic narratives are shaping the transfer of S&amp;T to Africa today, as part of SSC. Led by a team from the Institute of Development Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University and China Agricultural University, this research will offer a new perspective on the history of the GR that puts the focus on the domestic protagonists of the GR and their roles in contemporary S&amp;T transfers in the Global South.

This research has analytical development, policy enhancement and capacity building objectives. It will generate original evidence on the GRs of Brazil, China and India, with comparative insights that will inform debates in these countries about the role of the state in agricultural S&amp;T and the contribution of S&amp;T to sustainable development. It will also produce new insights on 21st century GRs, connecting domestic experiences with new forms of international S&amp;T transfers. This will feed policy and practice on SSC and inform debates on the role of S&amp;T to the sustainable development of agriculture in Africa. It will also make theoretical and methodological contributions by developing a framework that combines history, politics and discourse to the study of S&amp;T in development.","This research has three main areas of impact: analytical (the intellectual contribution to the relevant fields of expertise), instrumental (the contribution to policy debates and practice) and capacity development (the development of competences and skills of the PI and Co-Is).

Who will benefit from this research?
In addition to the research team, which will benefit directly from the opportunity to work collaboratively, across disciplines and with innovative methodologies, the research has two types of (external) beneficiaries: academic beneficiaries and policy beneficiaries.

Academic beneficiaries. This research will make a contribution to the study of GR across disciplines, and primarily to the fields of development studies, science and technology studies (STS) and the history of science. Academic beneficiaries will include researchers and research networks in the UK, Brazil, China, India and elsewhere interested in the history and politics of science and its connections to international development. The research will also be of interest to those studying the rising powers in global development and the transfer of policies, technologies and ideas within the Global South. Key networks include the ESRC STEPS Centre at Sussex, the ESRC Rising Powers and Interdependent Futures programme, the China International Development Research Network, the Transdisciplinary Research Cluster on Sustainability Studies in India, and the Africa-based Future Agricultures Consortium.

Policy beneficiaries. This research will target and seek to offer contributions to policy-makers and practitioners in the fields of agricultural development, agricultural science and technology, technology transfers and SSC. In Brazil, China and India, key actors to engage and influence are the leading national institutions for agricultural research, which played a direct and central part in these countries GR histories, including Embrapa, the China Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS) and the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI). Besides these prominent actors, other knowledge organisations have played a key part in the GR histories of these countries, including the University of Campinas and the Federal University of Vi&ccedil;osa, in Brazil, Punjab University in India and the regional universities linked to CAU in China. Some of these domestic players are also involved in SSC projects overseas. Furthermore, civil society organisations (CSOs) and social movements have actively engaged with domestic and international debates on GRs, agricultural S&amp;T and SSC are will therefore be interested in the findings from this research. These include, for example, in Brazil, the National Agroecology Articulation (ANA) and in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture in Hyderabad and the Kheti Virasat Mission in Punjab. Other key policy beneficiaries at the global level include organisations like CIMMYT, FAO, DFID and AGRA.

How will they benefit?
Research findings and policy lessons will be shared through published materials that will be distributed and made available through the IDS website. Outputs will comprise research and policy-focused publications, including journal articles, working papers, policy briefs and blogs. The research will also engage many beneficiaries directly in the co-production of research - for example, through participation in interviews and the generation of life stories and biographies of individuals at Embrapa, CAAS, IARI and relevant CSOs and movements. We will invite contributions to blogs, seeking to give space to a diverse range of perspectives on the GR and its role in SSC. We will also invite a selection of experts and practitioners to events to be hosted at IDS and at country level, offering an opportunity for joint learning and exchange. Country seminars will connect directly to contemporary debates on the GR and S&amp;T at national level, while offering a comparison with other contexts.","Xiuli Xu","Development studies","History","Science and Technology Studies","History of Sci./Med./Technol.","Nat Resources, Env & Rural Dev","Pol.,International Rel.&Dev.","Science and Technology Studies",NA,NA

In this project, we will study how financial frictions affected by beliefs of market participants, and the implication for monetary policy (such as a change in interest rates on productivity and growth). The expansionary monetary policy (higher money supply growth or easier lending conditions) in China after 2011 did not have the same expansionary effects on inflation and output as in the previous years. We will study how the presence of a particular type of frictions, limited commitment, significantly affects the impact of monetary policy and can explain the different effects observed in recent years. This study could shed light on the conduct of monetary policy, which will depend on the beliefs in the credit market and the firm size-productivity distribution.

Project 2: &quot;Search-and-matching for Liquidity in Financial Markets and Government Policies&quot;

According to World Bank data, between 2000 and 2013 in China, the quantity of money (M2) grew at a yearly rate of 16.2%: in the same period, the average yearly inflation rate was 2.4%, and the average yearly real GDP growth rate 8.7%. This means that, even after taking into account the high real GDP growth, the inflation rate in China has been systematically lower than what one would expect on the basis of the money supply growth rate.

Chinese financial markets are still not fully developed, and many privately issued assets are not very liquid. As a result, besides the transaction motive, economic agents' hold money also because of liquidity needs. The purpose of this project is to study how the higher liquidity needs (due to the low liquidity of the financial markets) affect the relations between monetary policy, inflation and economic growth, when beliefs about liquidity affect market participations. We will apply the study to understand the Chinese practice mentioned in the beginning, and discuss whether it is sustainable. 

We will study these issues by introducing asset liquidity frictions in an otherwise standard macroeconomic framework. In contrast to exogenous asset liquidity, expressed by a fixed fraction of assets sellable in a given period, endogenous asset liquidity is micro-founded and suitable for policy analysis. 

Project 3: &quot;Long Run Herd Behaviour and Volatility Clustering in Financial Markets&quot;

In the third project, we turn to another form of financial frictions, asymmetric information. 

Financial markets are crucial for good investment decisions. The ability of prices to aggregate dispersed information is fundamental for an efficient allocation of resources. We will study the informational efficiency of the Chinese financial markets through the use of novel financial markets models, with a specific focus on learning and herding. We will also study why asset prices exhibit time-varying volatility and the extent to which this is related to herd behaviour. We will then estimate the models using transactions data for the Chinese stock exchanges obtained from Wind Info. The structural estimation will allow us to quantify the drivers of herding and asset prices' time-varying volatility and their effect on market efficiency.","Our research will be of interest to academics, policy makers, and financial markets professionals.

To reach the academic community, we will present our projects at various stages of development in seminars, workshops and conferences. We will aim to publish our work in the very top scientific journals both in economics and in finance, so researchers who are interested in our work can further build upon the published work.

To reach policy makers, we will also try to publish preliminary versions of our work in working paper series such as the IMF Working Papers, the FED Staff Reports and the ECB Working Papers. In fact, we have already regularly done so in the past, see, e.g., Cui W. and Soeren Radde, 2016, &quot;Search-based Endogenous Asset Liquidity and the Macroeconomy,&quot; ECB WP1917; Cipriani M. and Guarino A., 2012 , &quot;Estimating a structural model of herd behavior in financial markets,&quot; Staff Reports 561, Federal Reserve Bank of New York. An important task of the overall project is to show how policy should react when financial markets can be shaped by variations in beliefs.

We plan to organize at least two two-day conferences for academics and policy makers on the theme of financial markets and growth in China: one in London and one in Shanghai (for example, Shanghai Jiaotong University, where the principle investigator has already established long-term relationship). The conference will bring together scholars and policy makers from the UK and China to share knowledge and facilitate communication. We plan to invite industry experts in Chinese financial markets. Such events can increase the industry impact of our research, and, on the other hand, result in useful feedback on our work from practitioners.

Professionals in the private sector will be interested in using our techniques in their work. They could benefit from understanding the linkage between the Chinese macroeconomy and its financial markets in a structural way. We will make our computer codes publicly available and will aim to make our methods widely known by participating in events with a broader audience than just academics and policy makers. In the past, the co-investigator has written for magazines for financial professionals, such as Collier Capital Magazine. The principle-investigator will work with the co-investigator on generating reports on Chinese financial markets to the general publics in the UK and China.

We would also like to mention that UCL has a consolidated record in engaging with users. For instance, the seminar and teaching activities of CEMMAP (UCL based centre funded by the ESRC) typically reach a variety of users. In addition, from October 2017 we will establish a new Centre for Finance (CfF) within the Department of Economics (Antonio Guarino will be the director and Wei Cui a research fellow); we will also use the activities of the CfF to reach a variety of users.

Finally, we would like to make our research visible to an even larger audience by creating a blog on &quot;China: Financial Markets and the Macroeconomy&quot;, which could potentially benefit their investment decisions and understanding of government policies in China. We will solicit experts interested in the Chinese economy, and, more in general, in developing economies, to contribute to the blog. We will also use other blogs, such as the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Blog (&quot;Libertystreet Economics&quot;), the LSE blog (&quot;Usappblog&quot;) and the IFS bog (&quot;Microeconomic Initiatives&quot;), where we have already been invited to present our work.","Antonio Guarino","Economics","Financial economics","Macroeconomics",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the wake of the global financial crisis, however, expectations of continuously rising levels of consumption have been substantially undermined in the USA and Western Europe (Ipsos Mori 2017; Pew 2013). The research will address this important but understudied social context. The project will analyse how the future of the consumption of goods and services is imagined by both professional practitioners engaged with 'futures' and the general public, and how such imagined futures shape, and are shaped by, social processes. 

Specialist futures consultancies, think tanks, corporations, and civil society organisations (CSOs) produce visions and models of the future of consumption. Such imagined futures may be grand visions of future consumer society, or more mundane scenarios for specific economic sectors (e.g. the future of retail). There is very limited scholarly work on this professional area, despite much market research with similar interests. However, representations and expectations of the future play a critical role in the present. Imagined futures, whether political utopias, models in public policy, or expectations in business planning, pave the roads toward the actual future. Visions of collective futures embody beliefs about the way the world works and about the nature of 'the common good', may inform everyday expectations, and may play critical social and political roles. The project will explore how these imagined futures of consumption are produced and circulated in society, through multiple research methods. 

Two case studies of organisations in this professional field will be conducted using participant observation: Forum for the Future, a CSO that works on sustainability and futures has already committed to host one study. A second will be sought with a futures consultancy. Around 30 interviews will be conducted with key informants in the futures field, including a research trip to interview members of think tank the Tellus Institute in Boston, USA, that have engaged with important scenarios and 'visioning' projects in this area. Examples of imagined futures of consumption will be systematically collated and analysed, as well as their coverage in news media tracked, to inform understanding of how such imagined futures circulate. A Stakeholder Advisory Group of senior figures is already committed to the project. The Group will identify research opportunities and collaborate in designing workshops through which futures practitioners will exchange knowledge with social scientists engaged with studying consumption and social change.

The second strand of empirical research will explore individuals' imagined futures of consumption, through a commissioned Mass Observation Archive (MOA) Directive. MOA Directives elicit written responses from its 450 volunteers (average 40% response rate) and have become an important resource for sociological research. They are ideally suited to elicit rich and detailed responses about expectations of everyday life and how people imagine themselves within history (Kramer 2013). The Directive will explore loss of faith in continuously rising living standards and how people imagine consumption may change for themselves and for future generations. The MOA data will be analysed and compared to the professional 'imagined futures' to explore resonances and differences. In collaboration with 'innovation lab' FutureEverything an artist/designer will be commissioned to develop visualisations of the MOA data - this will be used as the centre piece for a public exhibition, as well as in other public activities such as discussion panels held at Manchester Museum, that will explore and debate issues raised by the project.","The project's core impact agenda is to co-produce novel knowledge exchange between the professional futures and foresight field and the sociology of consumption. The project does not rigidly demarcate its academic research from knowledge exchange activities; rather knowledge exchange will inform the academic research, which in turn will open opportunities for knowledge exchange. Imagined futures of consumption are important sites of social and political contestation-whether the post-war vision of 'prosperity for all' or contemporary visions of sustainable consumption. Understanding how such visions shape, and are shaped by, social processes (Mische 2009) is an impactful sociological task. However, the professional field of futures and foresight has been dominated by technology-driven understandings of societal change and, more recently, innovation studies and socio-technical approaches, but has not been informed by the state of the art in the sociology of consumption. Furthermore, the futures field has the potential to amplify impact through its influence on corporations and civil society organisations. For example, key project stakeholder Forum for the Future (FftF) regularly develops strategy for multinational corporations and the project has established links to Unilever through the Stakeholder Group and the SCI-Unilever Strategic Partnership. Significant budget (12%) has been allocated to impact-related activities. 

The Stakeholder Advisory Group consisting of senior figures in the futures field (see letters of support) such as James Goodman (Director of Futures, FftT) and Sarah MacDonald (Director, Sustainable Living Plan, Unilever) is central to the project's impact agenda. The Group will be consulted on practitioners' research needs from the start of the project, and will co-develop the stakeholder workshop programme to maximise utility for practitioners. Critically, the Group will amplify the impact of project knowledge exchange through their own professional practice with corporations and NGOs. For example, Goodman has suggested co-development of new practice in FftF's futures work drawing on the PI and RA's social scientific expertise. Knowledge Exchange Workshops will bring together futures practitioners with leading sociologists of sustainable consumption with the goal of developing new practice around consumption futures (Year 2 Q2). Concrete outputs will be a Consumption Futures Toolkit for professional practice and a Stakeholder Report. The PI has extensive knowledge exchange experience (KE), including workshops (awarded in 2016 Exceptional Performance Award by University of Manchester for KE &quot;leadership and delivery&quot;).

The PI will collaborate with FutureEverything to commission an artist/designer to co-develop visualisations of project Mass Observation Archive Directive data, which will form the centre piece of public engagement, including, as minimum, a two day public exhibition, as well as being used in KE. In addition, two panel discussion events (Year 2 Q2) will be held at Manchester Museum, as well as public lectures at, e.g., FutureEverything Festival 2019.The skill development programme will include public engagement and curatorial training for the PI. The PI will be mentored on impact by the Director of FutureEverything. The PI has extensive professional experience in communications, as a copywriter, journalist, and magazine editor, has worked as Communications Officer for a large-scale academic project, and will use these skills to promote the project and disseminate findings through media articles, the project website and the Everyday Futures Network. The project will be flexible in exploiting impact opportunities as these arise in the course of research and will establish longer-term collaborative links with futures practitioners to extend the reach of the project to corporations, influential business groups and civil society (e.g. Royal Society of Arts-PI is a RSA Fellow).","Daniel Welch","Sociology","Cultural Studies","Economic Sociology","Social Theory","Sociology",NA,NA,NA,NA

Discontent with globalisation is fuelled by the deeply-rooted popular narrative that the &quot;new international division of labour&quot; - as outlined by Folker Fr&ouml;bel and colleagues in 1980 - has resulted in the offshoring of well-paying factory jobs from the industrial heartlands of the OECD to developing countries. This research project seeks to enrich our understanding of the economic and urban geography of contemporary globalization by troubling this narrative of the rise of BRICS and other 'emerging' countries at the expense of jobs and industry in the global North. It will document deindustrialisation in South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, and inform a nuanced understanding of the new international geography of deindustrialisation.

The 'alter-globalization' movement reached its zenith at the 'battle of Seattle' at the 1999 World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference. The movement's participants were diverse, but one common refrain was that in a liberalised global economy producers in developing countries would struggle to compete against lead-firms in the OECD. However, a consequence of trade liberalization that activists failed to anticipate was the rapid expansion of South-South trade. A 2015 report published by UNCTAD entitled 'Global Value Chains and South-South Trade' shows that from 1990-2010 South-South trade increased ~15% annually and the majority of intra-South trade originates in East Asia. As a result of exposure to competition from East Asia, local industry in many cities in South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America has been in severe decline (Rodrik 2016). Economist Dani Rodrik terms deindustrialisation in developing countries 'premature' because in contrast to the pattern observed in the OECD, it has taken place prior to a shift from manufacturing to servie-sector led growth, and he shows it has been more severe than deindustrialisation in advanced-industrialised countries such as the US and UK. This proposed research is the first comparative research project on deindustrialisation in the global South situated at the urban scale. It will focus on three cities where deindustrialisation has manifest itself differently - Kanpur, India; Dar es Salaam, Tanzania; and Buenos Aires, Argentina - and it will focus on three themes in each city.

1. Urban/regional planning and development - This will focus on the ways in which policy makers problematised deindustrialisation, and whether/how they sought to address it. In some cases they may have tried to protect domestic industry/labourers, while in other cases they may have simply sought to mitigate its impacts. This will be informed by policy documents and interviews with past and present government officials.

2. Business strategy, industrial policy and innovation - Strategies that allowed certain industries/firms to remain operational in each city will be identified. Possibilities include reducing labour costs, investing in technology and enhancing productivity, entering a joint venture with a more powerful firm, and/or subcontracting to informal sector producers. It will also evaluate whether policies that sought to assist domestic firms were successful. This will be informed by interviews with representatives of companies and industry groups.

3. Social welfare - This segment of the research determines the impact of deindustrialisation on labourers and documents their responses. It focuses on the ways labourers have adapted to changing labour markets (eg retraining or shifting to informal-sector activity), and it pays particular attention to the ways women and men have been affected differently (eg women's participation in the informal economy may have increased as the factory jobs available to men have disappeared).","This research strives to make demonstrable academic, societal and economic impacts. It will foster knowledge exchange with policy makers at multiple scales and other relevant stakeholders throughout the project. The research design will be co-produced with officials at the United Nations Environment Programme. This will allow UNEP officials to outline their needs, and influence the design - particularly of interview protocols - to ensure that the results inform their ongoing activities. This will take place at an initial workshop within the first three months of its commencement at the UNEP headquarters in Paris, and I will send policy briefs to UNEP officials as they are produced. Finally, I will return to the UNEP headquarters to present the findings of research and policy recommendations within the final three months of the project. This engagement will allow UNEP to assist in the dissemination of findings to its partner institutions throughout its extensive knowledge network, and it builds on my existing relationship with UNEP. I have participated in advisory board meetings of the UNEP's Global Initiative for Resource Efficient Cities at UN Habitat meetings in Mexico and Ecuador. Furthermore, UNEP invited me to deliver a keynote address at the Asia Pacific Urban Forum in 2015 in Indonesia. Finally, I recently edited a themed section of articles on the UN Habitat's New Urban Agenda for the International Development Planning Review, and the section included an article authored by the Deputy Head of the Secretariat of the Climate and Clean Air Coalition (UNEP), Martina Otto, and Sharon Gil, a Programme Officer (UNEP).
Within the first three months of the research project's commencement the Co-Is will approach their existing contacts within national and municipal governments, industry and civil society, to solicit their input and obtain a better understanding of their particular needs (e.g. what aspects of deindustrialisation remain unknown and/or particularly vexing?):
-India: Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, Kanpur Municipal Corporation, State Government of Uttar Pradesh
-Tanzania: Dar es Salaam City Council and the Ministry of Industry and Trade
-Argentina: Ministry of Production and the Buenos Aires Strategic Planning Council
A number of city-specific questions will be included in the surveys on the basis of these consultations. These and other key stakeholders from industry and civil society will be invited to a workshop during the last two weeks of research in each city. The PI and Co-Is will present preliminary findings and distribute policy briefs with in-depth recommendations for urban planning, industrial policy, business strategy and social welfare. If policy makers follow-up and express interest in implementing any of the recommendations the PI will apply for funds from the University of Manchester's impact acceleration account to invite them to the final workshop. This will solidify a channel for knowledge exchange, and provide opportunities for sustained future knowledge exchange and engagement.
This research has the potential to disrupt the widely-held belief that the global South has industrialised at the expense of well-paying factory jobs in the global North, which has undoubtedly fuelled right-wing populism in recent years. A range of strategies will be employed to influence public discourse. First, a public event will be hosted by the Manchester Urban Institute; previous events have been very well attended. Second, I will apply to organize an exhibition at the People's History Museum in Manchester. Previous exhibitions have focused on impacts of deindustrialisation in the UK, and this would show visitors how deindustrialisation impacts cities and workers around the world. Finally, I would author articles for outlets with which I have an existing relationship, such as Making It Magazine (the official magazine of UNIDO), and also pitch articles to editors at popular outlets such as The Guardian.","Seth Schindler","Development studies","Human Geography","Development Geography","Geography and Development","Human Geography (General)","Urban Geography",NA,NA,NA

Because there are many different types of information that are used when making these decisions, and because of the many aspects of thought that come into play, exploring the process by experiments alone would be costly, time-consuming, and limited in terms of determining the mental representations/processes involved. To date, no theory of deception detection has integrated the many aspects of cognition such as attention, goal-planning, and long term memory, all of which are required to decide whether an SMS message is genuine or deceptive. By relying on a well-established and tested theory, the computational model can explore these issues in a cost-effective and relatively time-efficient manner. This project is innovative insofar as it will be the first domain-general model of deception detection.

Work package 1 will develop a domain-general computational model in the context of SMS deception detection. The ACT-R cognitive architecture has been extensively tested and developed for over 40 years. It is a theory of the key structures and processes of the human mind that integrates the many aspects of cognition. This project will use the ACT-R framework to implement a computational model of deception detection. The model will be explored to test how people act when (i) their attention is drawn to factors such as an urgent response being required, (ii) the content of the message and the general suspiciousness of the individual are varied, and (iii) an intervention is implemented, such as giving the option to delay responding to an SMS. These factors will be tested with the ACT-R framework in work package 1.

Work package 2 will explore the ACT-R model with experimental testing. These studies will mix laboratory control with real-world application. Participants will interact with a mobile phone while their eye movements are recorded. Eye movement data provides precise timing on what information they are drawn to in the SMS scam and the decision of whether reply or delete the text. This precise timing information allows the project to test the predictions of the ACT-R deception detection model.

Work package 3 will develop an intervention based on the results of work packages 1 and 2. Consulting with North Yorkshire police and an SMS scam-prevention organisation (The AntiSocial Engineer Ltd.), and in collaboration with a computer scientist, a cell phone-based application will be developed. Although the exact nature of the application will depend on the findings of the first two work packages, based on the current theories in deception detection it is anticipated that the application may scan for key words, encourage users to verify information by searching online, or allow users to press an 'unsure' button, which will hide the SMS message until they can give time to checking the authenticity of the text.

This project aligns with the ESRC research priorities of 'ways of being in a digital age' and 'productivity'. Police forces have limited resources to investigate personal SMS scams, while scam-prevention organisations are noting that SMS attacks are on the rise. The outcome of this project - a smartphone application - aims to encourage users to consider the possibility of a scam and to act with a 'healthy scepticism' in the digital world. A reduced risk of engaging with scams will lessen the burden on police forces and aid scam-prevention organisations in delivering evidence-based interventions to potential victims.

We will also work with a local child safeguarding board to translate the model into understanding the tendency to overbelieve offenders in the context of social work, where deception is estimated to be involved in 75% of cases in England &amp; Wales where a child is killed.","The project will produce a number of outputs. The project will result in a domain-general computational model of deception detection. The model will integrate important aspects of cognition into the judgment process and provide predictions regarding the moment-by-moment dynamics of the judgment process. This model will be made available to researchers through the Open Science Framework. A tutorial article submitted to Behavior Research Methods will accompany the model so that researchers unfamiliar with ACT-R can adapt it to their needs. The PI will email collaborators and send emails to relevant societies to advertise the availability of this model.

The project will be of direct benefit to organisations aiming to reduce consumer fraud, including policing authorities. The writing of this bid, development of experiments and dissemination of the findings has been/will be conducted with consultation from North Yorkshire Police and The AntiSocial Engineer Ltd. One output from the project is a cell phone application that will implement the psychological findings into a technological intervention. This intervention will benefit the general public, another direct beneficiary of the project. The application will be advertised through news media, the policing and social engineering networks, and at a public engagement event in West Yorkshire.

An indirect beneficiary of the project are those organisations who wish to encourage a healthy scepticism in their employees. The job contract of a social worker explicitly notes that employees should be suspicious of parents' claims, but this does not translate into practice, as evidenced in a number of case reviews. Lord Laming called for a 'respectful uncertainty' of caregivers' claims. The current project aims to encourage users to engender a healthy scepticism. The findings of this project could indirectly benefit social work. Bradford Local Child Safeguarding Board will act as a consultant on the project to translate the findings into relevant practice for social workers as part of a symposium. The PI has worked with the organisation previously to translate his theoretical work into practical significance for social workers.

This project addresses the RCUK's impact aims by:

(1) increasing the effectiveness of a public service, namely the policing authority. It does so by encouraging users to be more sceptical of potential scams. 
(2) fostering economic performance and competitiveness of the United Kingdom by developing evidence-based solutions for social engineering firms.
(3) enhancing the quality of life by reducing the possibility of being a victim of fraud.","Christopher Street","Psychology","Cognitive Psychology","Experimental Psychology","Social Psychology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

(2) It takes advantage of a valuable opportunity to compare policy divergences and create the first cross-comparative dataset on civil society activity in youth unemployment in the context of devolution. (3) It will tell us something new and different about what works and what doesn't work in policy and practice within and between four different policy contexts relevant to any country that has decentralised or devolved systems of welfare provision. 
 
Currently 17% of young people are unemployed across Western Europe. In the UK where around 5.4% people are unemployed, 16-24 year olds are nearly three times more likely to be out of work (12.5%). With dropping population wages -nearly &pound;1,600 lower than five years ago- affecting young people in their twenties more (&pound;1,800 lower), hard line austerity measures in the UK since 2010 affecting the cost of living and of wages, increase in precarious employment, the rising cost of further education coupled with welfare reform and tightening government provision for the unemployed means more young unemployed people are dependant on charity support; and civil society organisations are a crucial stop-gap in this scenario. Yet we know little about how civil society organisations operate within and between the four nations of the UK and even less about the effect that devolution is having on their role in youth unemployment. The study will address this gap in knowledge and show which elements of policy, practice and state-civil society relationships seem most effective, ineffective, productive and promising; and crucially, why.

Recent UK central government policies to migate youth unemployment have focused on routes into work such as; 'widening access' programmes for universities, encouraging continued education, boosting apprenticeships and placing duties on local authorities to enforce these measures. However, approaches to delivery, scale and supplementation of these policies (e.g. through Work Experience schemes) varies and civil society or not-for-profit organisations, commonly termed the 'third sector', plays a role in balancing-out this variation. Some groups lobby government for better youth unemployment policy and provision, some work with government to shape and delivery policies and some provide additional services and resources for young, out of work people; but all, as research has shown, are likely to become both more important as the consequences of austerity measures and public sector cuts play-out and more divergent as devolution progresses. 

Understanding civil society involvement in youth unemployment relies heavily on the social and political contexts within which they are working. However, existing studies tend to treat the UK as 'one' welfare state when in fact devolution since 1998 has steadily eroded the accuracy of this. The UK has four different governments, four very different policy approaches to youth unemployment which means important differences between welfare provision and the role of civil society. The findings from this research will provide the first full picture of civil society's role in devolved youth unemployment policy and provision. 

The findings will also have implications for the UK's exit from the EU. Both Wales and Northern Ireland rely heavily on EU youth unemployment initiatives and funding. The extent to which this gap will be filled by the UK government remains unknown, but if funding decreases the role of the third sector in providing welfare for the young unemployed could become more important in filling an ever widening gap in welfare.","This research will generate knowledge on different approaches to youth unemployment and outcomes, with a focus on civil society. Therefore, the findings will yield important opportunities to realise impact through shared learning on divergent approaches to tackling youth unemployment (see Pathways to Impact for details). Devolution of power to sub-national administrations has meant divergence in policy approaches to tackling youth unemployment under four UK governments, subsequently there are divergent patterns of civil society involvement in tackling youth unemployment and equally divergent outcomes. Knowledge and understanding of these outcomes, and their varying effectiveness could inform, influence, shape or better align policy with extant activity.

Government and policy makers:
The UK government has allocated &pound;61.4b to education and &pound;6.3b to work and pensions in its 2017/18 spring budget. Within these departments initiatives for tackling youth unemployment will be funded, monitored and evaluated. The role of civil society in tackling youth unemployment if far less clearly funded and evaluated. The NCVO almanac provides broad details of civil society work but does not specify youth unemployment, neither does it stipulate funding amounts. In addition, there is no collated or centralised information on either youth unemployment initiatives/cases undertaken by civil society or their outcomes. This amounts to a large gap in knowledge for government in terms of the ways in which Treasury-funded initiatives are being complemented, contradicted or (un)affected by parallel civil society work. Such knowledge and information would allow the relevant departments within UK central government and the three devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to better focus and target and work with civil society to tackle youth unemployment; opening the possibility of reducing or reallocating resources. 
The UK government's Communities and Local Government Comttee has been contacted and informed about this potential research; as has the Parliamentary Outreach Service which carried out work in collaboration with WISERD, and the PI, in the past year. 

Devolved administrations:
The UK 's spring budget also allocates &pound;14.2b, &pound;13.4b and &pound;10b to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland respectively over 2017/18. Each devolved administration will allocate part of this bloc grant towards tackling youth unemployment (see case for support for details on devolved policies and approaches) and will monitor their own initiatives internally. Furthermore, Scotland and soon Wales have tax raising powers (explaining the recent drop in Scottish bloc grant funding) and the Scottish Government has legislative control over certain areas of welfare provision. 
The National Assembly for Wales Committee for Young People and Education has expressed an interest in the project findings with two meeting to discuss the design having taken place in July 2017. The National Assembly Committee on Young People and Education, the Northern Irish government's Committee for Communities has expressed an interest in the findings (see Appendix 2) and the Scottish government's Committee on Education and Skills and Economy, Jobs and Fair Work have been contacted and informed about the potential for this project to gauge potential interest in future findings.

Civil society and young people:
Shared learning within and between groups of civil society organisations tackling youth unemployment in the four nations of the UK, through a central dataset, will illuminate the different approaches and their outcomes in an informative and useful learning process. Shared learning for improved and more co-ordinated approaches to tackling youth unemployment will also benefit the young people receiving welfare provision, those seeking employment and those in precarious employment.","Sioned Pearce","Social Policy","Sociology","Political Sociology","Social Policy",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Transnational mnemonic dynamics have been explored in relation to international relations, films, monuments and new media, however international tourism as a key field for transnational contacts has received only limited attention. The project examines the construction and contestation of cultural memory in transnational touristic encounters, focusing on the example of Russian tourism to three post-Soviet cities. Every year thousands of Russians travel to cities that used to be part of their own state during the Tsarist and Soviet periods and became part of newly independent nation-states after the break-up of the Soviet Union. These tourist mobilities provide opportunities for the negotiation of cultural memories and local heritage sites as tour guides tell tourists stories about the destinations they are visiting and tourists arrive with particular expectations and perceptions of places and their pasts. These interpersonal encounters are situated in a context of shifting geopolitical relations and on-going tensions between Russia and its neighbours, particularly in relation to the interpretation of the shared past. Focusing on the perspectives and interactional dynamics of tourists and tour guides, the project will illuminate what memories and identities in relation to the contested past can be found in tourism across different national contexts. 

The project addresses four research questions: 

RQ1: What cultural memories are produced in transnational encounters between tourists and tour guides? 
RQ2: What are tour guides' approaches to and experiences of working with tourists? 
RQ3: How do tourists relate to places and enact identities through memory practices? 
RQ4: How is memory-making in tourism shaped by different national contexts and power relations? 

The project uses the innovative methodological design of a comparative ethnographic study of tourism in three purposefully selected cities, Tallinn, Estonia, Kyiv, Ukraine, and Almaty, Kazakhstan, which have significant numbers of Russian tourists and differ distinctly in their historical and present relations to Russia. The research is based on participant observations of guided tours and semi-structured interviews with tour guides and tourists, which will be brought together in a &quot;thick comparison&quot; of the three case studies. The methodological approach makes use of the traditional openness of the ethnographic method while at the same time the selection of key sites and practices of memory-making allows for systematic comparisons across cases. 

Contributions

The project will make an important intervention in memory studies by drawing attention to the productivity of tourism for memory making. It will also contribute to tourism studies and the understanding of the post-Soviet space by expanding the study of tourism beyond tourists from the West and by broadening understanding of memory and identity constructions in the post-Soviet space against the background of on-going tensions between Russia and its neighbours. To benefit non-academic users, the project will provide insights into existing heritage communication, which will facilitate the development of practice-oriented lessons for future guiding practice.","The focus of this research is on the production of cultural memories in tourism in the post-Soviet space. Tourist encounters constitute an important arena for the communication about the past, creating the opportunity to learn and enhance understanding for the other but also for the reproduction of stereotypes and possibly conflicting accounts of the past. The project will help to understand current memory practices in tourism in the post-Soviet region, to develop strategies for improving heritage communication and to foster reflexivity among tour guides and tourists. Beyond academic beneficiaries, the research will be beneficial to multiple and diverse audiences, including tour guides, tourism managers and tourists as well as the wider public. 

The project will be of immediate relevance to commercial tour operators and tour guides who offer services for Russian visitors and interact with them on an everyday level. The research will help to capture current strategies of tour guides and to reflect on challenges and good practices in working with tourists. A pilot study in one of the case study locations revealed that tensions over how to remember the past occur regularly between tour guides and tourists and guides largely develop their strategies on how to deal with them individually on the basis of past experience. The project seeks to examine these strategies more systematically and develop guidelines for the communication of contested memories and heritage sites, aiming to shape future guiding practices. 
The research will also be of immediate interest for tourist managers working in the tourist information centres and tourist organisations of the case study sites as well as the national tourism boards in these countries. The research findings will help them to better understand the current perceptions and experiences of Russian tourists, one of their most significant markets. In the long-term it will help them in the planning and development of tourism marketing. 
Finally, tourists may benefit from reflecting on their experiences and situating them in a wider context. Pilot interviews and an analysis of online travel blogs showed uncertainty in how they are perceived by locals. 

How will these impacts be achieved? 

The impacts will be achieved through a series of exchanges with tour guides and tourist managers (including meetings, interviews and participant observations); through the communication of key research findings and the development of recommendations based on them: guidelines on heritage communication will be developed for tour guides in collaboration with them, a report on tourist perceptions will be published for tourist managers. Guidelines and reports will be sent to them directly by post and made available on the project website. Reflexivity among tourists will be encouraged through interviews as well as an interactive website which will showcase examples of how tourism can encourage understanding and learning. The delivery of these activities will be shaped by the PI's existing knowledge exchange skills and support from the project mentor and advisory board.","Alena Pfoser","Area Studies","Human Geography","Sociology","Cultural Studies","European Studies","Recreation/Tourism Geography",NA,NA,NA

Theory predicts that a sudden increase in the supply of skilled workers is likely to reduce skilled wages. In the longer run skills can adjust, increased skills can have spillovers such as on innovation, and the competitiveness of the economy may change as skilled work becomes cheaper. We know little about the size and speed of adjustments of wages and skills to a skilled labour supply shock, and its spillovers and effects on the local economy. 

I propose to study these responses by focusing on the labour supply shock induced by the mass migration of relatively skilled East Germans to West Germany after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. The insights from this research have important implications for policies on wages, employment, skills and competitiveness in response to structural economic transformations, not only for Germany but for most other countries. In particular, the project will address the following main questions. 

(1) Does a larger number of skilled workers reduce the wages of skilled workers? What are the dynamics of wage and employment adjustments in the short and longer run? For understanding these responses better, I will also examine productivity effects and changes due to differential rent sharing, as the bargaining power of skilled workers changes with their relative supply.

(2) What are the spillovers of increasing the supply of skilled workers in the economy? One effect of price adjustments is that the incentives to acquire skills and to work in specific occupations change. I will document these effects, for example, by using data on the task intensity of specific occupations. By constructing a new dataset on patenting in East and West Germany, I will also examine to what extent larger numbers of skilled workers foster local innovation.

(3) Do changes in the skill composition affect the long-term trajectory of a local economy by changing its comparative advantage? I will assess the creation and growth of firms in response to the skilled labour supply shock, and analyse the difference in responses across firms and industries for tradable and non-tradable goods.

A particular strength of the proposed analysis is its research design, which uses a historic event to generate quasi-experimental variation in the data. After the Berlin Wall fell in November 1989, around two million East Germans moved to West Germany until the early 1990s, increasing the West German labour force by over three percent by 1992. This large-scale immigration provides a particularly useful case study of a large skilled labour supply shock because the migration from East to West Germany after 1989 was sudden and unanticipated, and East and West Germans speak the same language. 

Evidence on the causal effects of labour supply shocks is scarce because it is difficult to isolated causal outcomes from confounding endogenous factors such as prevailing local economic conditions. To overcome this difficulty, I propose to construct data on the historical settlement patterns of East Germans in West Germany, which I use to predict the location of newly arriving East Germans after the fall of the Berlin Wall. For implementing this research design, I will extract novel information from two detailed secure-access administrative datasets, which have not been used in this context before.

The scientific output of the proposed research is aimed at publication in top academic journals, and I expect my contributions to advance the academic as well as the policy debate on the evolution of skills, wages, and comparative economic advantage in response to labour market shocks. A thorough understanding of these effects is crucial for workers, firms, governments and international institutions to make informed policy choices.","Besides its intellectual merit, the results from the proposed research have immediate policy relevance. Knowledge on how an increase in the number of skilled workers impact on wages, employment, innovation and the productivity of local labour markets is crucial for informed policy making in the UK and elsewhere. From the onset of the project period I aim to maximise impact by building links and contacts with potential beneficiaries and users of the research. Potential beneficiaries include:

1) The academic community: The scientific output of the proposed research is aimed at publication in top academic journals, and I expect the findings of this project to advance significantly the academic debate on the effects of skilled workers on the economy. The results of this research can further serve as an empirical basis for developing theoretical models of the labour supply and firm responses in fields of economics such as labour and public economics, the economics of innovation and productivity, and trade and migration economics. 

2) Governments, organisations, the broader policy community and NGOs: Output from the proposed research will be beneficial for policy makers in the UK and abroad. The research questions addressed in this project are particularly timely, with labour markets around the world facing significant structural changes due to import competition, outsourcing, migration or automation. Knowledge about labour supply and demand effects for workers of difference skill groups is crucial for drafting policies in response to such changes. Institutions such as UK government departments, ministries of other countries, the European Commission, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and NGOs and think tanks may employ the findings of the proposed research to make economic predictions, to devise better measures that can ameliorate inequality and skills shortages, and more generally to advise countries on the implementation of labour market policies. 

3) The media and the general public: The findings of the proposed research are likely to be of utmost interest to the media, the general public, the business community and worker unions. The results from the proposed research have direct relevance for informing the media and the general public about the effects of structural labour market changes, and thereby will contribute to more informed debates about important policy choices. For economic agents such as workers, entrepreneurs and firms, better understanding and predictions about the consequences of changed numbers of skilled workers in an economy will improve decision making.","Alice Kuegler","Economics","Industrial Organisation (R&D)","International economics","Labour economics","Public economics",NA,NA,NA,NA

If you don't experience depression yourself, it's likely that someone you care about does. The best psychological 'talking therapy' for depression is Cognitive Behavioural Therapy - commonly referred to as 'CBT'. Although CBT helps with depression, around half of people who complete a course of CBT still have depressive symptoms. This has a huge impact on the individuals' quality of life, their families, and the economy. It is therefore vitally important that we improve psychological therapies like CBT so that more people can beat depression. 

One way of trying to improve CBT is to use experimental, cognitive psychology to find out what stops CBT working. Research has shown that certain styles of remembering or thinking about things interfere with how well people respond to CBT. If we can find a way to change these 'cognitive problems', then CBT should work better at shifting depression. One such cognitive problem occurs when people struggle to remember details about events from their past - what we call autobiographical memories. Being able to easily bring to mind detailed autobiographical memories is very important for a number of everyday mental skills essential to our psychological health. We need good access to detailed autobiographical memories to successfully solve everyday problems, to make accurate judgements about ourselves and the world around us, and to see both positive and negative things that might happen whenever we plan how to deal with a challenging experience (e.g., working hard to meet a deadline at work).
 
When someone experiences depression, the autobiographical memories they bring to mind are often very vague and broad and negative (e.g., my life has always been awful). People with depression find it very hard to reach those detailed autobiographical memories that they need to navigate everyday life, which keeps their depression going. How does this relate to CBT? Well, those everyday skills of problem-solving, sound judgement, and careful planning that require good access to autobiographical memories, are the very same skills we need in order to successfully engage with CBT. For instance, a common task in CBT for depression is to identify the negative thoughts that keep depression going (e.g., I never do well at anything) and then gather 'evidence' from the person's life to show that the thoughts aren't true (e.g. last week I cooked a nice meal). However, this evidence-gathering critically relies on being able to remember past events that contradict the thoughts. So, problems with autobiographical memory may not only keep depression going, but may also interfere with CBT that is designed to treat depression. 

In this project we want to develop and test a new technique that can temporarily boosts people's ability to access their detailed autobiographical memories. We will then determine that improving autobiographical memory in this way then improves those problem-solving, judgement and planning skills that depend on autobiographical memories. Finally, we will test whether this booster technique improves depressed people's ability to do tasks that are similar to CBT, such as challenging negative thoughts. If our technique works, in the future we could provide depressed people a way to 'switch on' a detailed way of remembering things that they can use before a CBT session in order to get the most out of therapy. In this way, this project will use laboratory work with depressed volunteers to explore a new technique that could help to improve treatments for depression in the future. 

Our key goals, then, are to: 1) Develop a technique to boost access to detailed autobiographical memories in depressed people; 2) Evaluate whether this memory booster technique improves both a) everyday mental skills like solving problems, and planning, and b) depressed people's ability to successfully complete the sorts of tasks that they would be asked to do in CBT.","As this project is at the interface between experimental and clinical psychology, the findings will be of wide interest with implications for those with mental health disorders and the practitioners and systems which aim to mitigate the effect of mental illness on individuals, society, and the economy. An extensive programme of impact activities has been planned to ensure maximum impact. 

INDIVIDUALS WITH DEPRESSION: Approximately 50% of individuals with mental health disorders begin cognitive therapy and are disheartened to realise that the treatment is not working for them. The results of this project will offer an explanation as to why cognitive therapy can feel so hard. More broadly, the results will demonstrate the role of memory in why individuals might find it hard to solve problems or to come up with explanations that differ from their usual, unhelpful way of seeing things. Understanding the cause of these difficulties is likely to empower individuals and improve hope in the effectiveness of psychological-based intervention. Extensive dissemination has been planned to ensure that the results reach as many depressed individuals as possible. To ensure co-production of knowledge, individuals with lived experience of depression have been involved in planning this research, and will co-facilitate dissemination of results. Ultimately, the aim of this project is to use experimental psychology to take early but vitally important steps toward improving the efficacy of psychological treatment, and thereby quality of life for the one in four individuals affected by mental illness around the world. 

COMMUNITY: The results are likely to also be of interest to the families and friends of those affected by depression. In particular, further knowledge of the cognitive difficulties that depressed individuals experience will increase understanding of how their daily functioning is reduced by depression. A public Q&amp;A session co-facilitated by individuals with loved ones with depression will enhance impact in this area. 

MENTAL HEALTH CARE PRACTITIONERS: Clinicians providing psychological treatment in public, private, and not-for-profit organisations will benefit from the increased understanding that this project will provide regarding why some individuals struggle to complete cognitive-based therapy. Demonstrating the role that autobiographical memory plays in the completion of cognitive-based tasks, and in predicting psychological treatment response, will allow recommendations to be made regarding how a clinician can refine their delivery of cognitive therapy (e.g., by supplementing therapy with memory-based techniques). This will improve patient engagement, and thereby treatment response. Two training workshops for clinicians have been included in the programme of impact activities to ensure that the findings are used to this effect. 

PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEMS AND POLICY MAKERS: Improving treatment of mental health issues is a key priority for the UK government and health organisations around the world. Identifying cognitive barriers to treatment effects, and using experimental psychology to elicit the mechanisms through which these barriers impact treatment, is important if we are to improve and advance psychological intervention. In this way, this project will indicate the utility of using autobiographical memory to inform a personalised treatment approach. In such an approach, those individuals experiencing trouble with autobiographical memory retrieval could be offered adjunctive treatment techniques that can be combined with current evidence-based practice to improve treatment effects for the individual. Importantly, autobiographical memory-based techniques would offer a low-cost and low-resource addition to treatment. This work will therefore offer important implications for the role that experimental psychology can play in innovating and improving care options.","Caitlin Hitchcock","Psychology","Cognitive Psychology","Experimental Psychology","Health Psychology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It is based on two fundamental research questions: 1) How do innovation narratives at industrial policy and firm levels interact in the context of UK infrastructure? and 2) What are the implications of this interaction for people and firms? The UK infrastructure sector faces a challenge in delivering targets of reducing costs of investment in infrastructure assets and improving their quality through innovation. The interaction between industry- and firm-levels innovation narratives have direct implications for the innovative capabilities of firms across the sector (Bartel and Garud, 2009; Denning, 2008). By improving innovative capabilities of the infrastructure firms, the project will help to solve a 'productivity puzzle' - a long-term slowdown in UK productivity growth. 
The current literature is largely silent on the ways in which narratives of innovation at industry and organisational levels interact. This is the gap in knowledge that the proposed research project will aim to fulfil. There is undoubtedly increasing interest amongst scholars of innovation in the importance of narratives, although there remains little consistency in terms of theoretical approach and scarce empirical investigation (Beckman and Marry, 2009). This 'narrative turn' in innovation studies focuses on understanding how the meaning of innovation is socially constructed through the use of narratives (Vaara et al., 2016). In this project, narratives are seen as unique discursive construction that embodies unity of purpose, a degree of coherence together with connotations of performative intent. Although rarely fixed or completely monolithic, narratives are nevertheless often repeated in organisations (Dailey and Browning, 2014). Narratives are often spoken, but there are other forms of performed narratives such as written and symbolic/visual. These are often reproduced on policies and reports, corporate websites, or in other externally-facing marketing material. Narratives hence may carry important messages at the level of the firm and at a sectoral level, and have important implications for developing strategies. Senior managers play an active role in the construction of such narratives, as they are responsible for formulating and disseminating an organisational vision and strategies (Sims, 2003; Sonenshein, 2010). Narratives of innovation also play an important role in constructing individual and collective identities (Vaara et al., 2016). For example, firms become recognised as innovative through the narratives they adopt. 
Innovation narratives will be examined based on the textual and visual data publicly available from innovation policies, government and industry innovation reports and strategies; and narrative interviews with established industry collaborators, including but not limited to Costain, Anglian Water, Galliford Try, Thames Tideway Tunnel, High Speed Two, as stated in the letters of support. Narrative interviews are likely to encourage interviewees to talk about innovations with the reference to organisational values and the vision of the industry to move forward (Soderberg, 2006).
The three-year research programme will result in new scholarly knowledge on innovation narratives in UK infrastructure. The new investigator (PI) will be based at the Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, University College London, working with Prof Andrew Davies as a mentor along with other leading researchers in the area of innovation and narrative research. ESRC New Investigator Grant will support the advancement of the investigator's and employed researcher's research and leadership skills. It will expand international collaboration network that would potentially lead to joint 4* publications and application for a larger ESRC grant proposal.","This research project is likely to have societal, economic and academic impact at policy, business, voluntary and public engagement levels. Long-term collaborations with infrastructure project-based organisations are going to become opportunities for changing their identities from the traditional, not innovative and slow in changing practices to value-driven, innovative driven by leadership organisations. This project has a potential to increase innovation activities of UK infrastructure organisations, achieve greater alignment of innovation narratives with the innovation agenda of the industry, and consequently solve a 'productivity puzzle', a long-term slowdown in UK productivity growth. This research project will develop a mobile application that infrastructure companies will be able to use in order to evaluate their innovativeness and learn from best practices. This will enable infrastructure organisations to become more innovative by creating new innovation manager roles, recognise and reward innovation champions, develop innovation strategies and programmes. 
This project will advance knowledge about narratives of innovation, as currently there is a lack of theoretical and methodological consistency in their understanding. There is an increasing interest and recognition of a 'narrative turn' in organisation and innovation studies, but little is known about the role, nature of innovation narratives and their interaction between industry an organisational level. This project will contribute to the existing knowledge of innovation narratives in project-based firms. It will open up a new way of understanding the ways meanings of innovation is constructed through narratives. This project will help scholars to use findings and apply ideas from narrative theory and methodology to understanding different concepts. It will open up a new theoretical and empirical framing that can potentially be used to understand narratives about different organisational phenomena. 
This project will likely foster partnerships with business and industry in the form of Knowledge Transfer Partnerships and Industrial Case Studentships to achieve economic and societal impact. In the field of the Built Environment, these types of partnerships between academia, businesses and professional institutions are important for the knowledge exchange and impact that occurs from the movement of people from research into industry and vice versa. This will result in new employments of new researchers and PhD students at the UCL Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management under the applicant's supervision. 
Knowledge exchange activities will be at the core of this research project. Collaboration with colleagues, narrative theorists overseas, industry partners will result in better understanding of innovation narratives in infrastructure. It will result in building new professional and personal relationships, joint publications and follow-up research activities. Dissemination of the research findings will be in the form of journal publications, short summary reports, via social media and the Bartlett newsletter. A public lecture will be offered to UCL by the PI and RA to share the research findings to general public. This project will engage with young generations to attract them to work in UK infrastructure industry by sharing personal experiences, telling stories about the research projects. This will be achieved by participation in the university open days, sharing the stories via social media (LinkedIn, Twitter). 
ESRC New Investigator Grant will support the applicant in becoming a more independent researcher through gaining experience of leading the research project and supervising a Research Associate employed on the Grant. It will support the development and advancement of their research and leadership skill, and will have an impact on career progression and academic promotions.","Natalya Sergeeva","Management & Business Studies","Innovation","Leadership","Organisational Studies",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In some uncertain situations we may be able to weigh up the options, predict the outcome, and make an informed choice, whilst in other uncertain situations we have very little information with which to make a judgement. Excessive stress in response to uncertainty is common in anxiety disorders. The term Intolerance of Uncertainty (IU) refers to individual differences in anticipating and reacting to uncertainty, with those high in IU having a more negative reaction to uncertainty than those low in IU. Recent work suggests that understanding IU may be important for the diagnosis and treatment of anxiety disorders. Despite these recent advances, very little is understood about exactly how the processing of uncertainty differs in individuals who are low and high in IU, and how this is related to anxiety. 

The proposed programme of research will characterise how individuals high in IU differ from those low in IU when faced with uncertainty. Some of the questions that will be addressed are: 

1. Do individuals with higher levels of IU have a broader threshold for detecting uncertainty in their environment than individuals low in IU? 

2. Do individuals high in IU differ from those low in IU only when the uncertainty is associated with the potential for something bad to happen or is all uncertainty aversive? 

3. Do individuals high in IU cope with uncertainty differently to those low in IU? Do they seek more information to enforce some certainty, or do they avoid uncertain situations altogether? 

To address these questions, the research will make use of state of the art technologies which will allow us to measure what captures people's attention and how they feel whilst they complete computer based tasks that emulate uncertain situations. 

This research has important implications for theories of anxiety and, importantly, by better understanding the nature of IU and how it is associated with anxiety, the research will help us to design new ways of intervening and treating people with anxiety disorders. This would improve the quality of life of the people in question and provide a benefit to society by decreasing the economic burden of long-term mental health problems.","In the UK, anxiety disorders are common, affecting over eight million people. Anxiety disorders place a significant financial burden on the suffering individual and society, costing the economy approximately &pound;10 billion a year. In order to obtain cost-effective targeted treatment, better characterisation of psychological processes that underlie anxiety disorder pathology are needed. Recent theoretical and empirical work suggests that fear of the unknown, captured by individual differences in Intolerance of Uncertainty (IU), plays a central role in anxiety disorder pathology. The aim of the proposed project is to provide research outputs that directly inform the development of treatments for anxiety disorders that target IU-related mechanisms. 

The most important potential impact of this research is in improving the quality of life of people with anxiety disorders via an enhanced understanding of IU-related psychological processes that give rise to anxiety. IU has a robust association with worry and anxiety and recent work suggests that it may have relevance for other mental health disorders that have an anxiety component (e.g. depression and obsessive compulsive disorder). Research has begun to examine whether IU can be targeted in treatment for anxiety disorders and initial findings show promise. On this basis the study of IU has gained substantial momentum in recent years and now sits at the forefront of anxiety research. Despite these recent advances, very little is understood about exactly how the processing of uncertainty differs in individuals who are low and high in IU, and how this is related to anxiety.

By providing insights into the characterisation of IU and how it contributes to anxiety, the research has clear potential to impact a range of beneficiaries. Academically, the research will inform theoretical understanding of IU's role in anxiety. In addition, the research will be of interest to academics and clinicians working to develop evidence-based teatments for anxiety disorders. 

The outputs from the research have the potential to enhance treatment for people with anxiety, directly through the PIs own future work and indirectly, via the work of other academics and clinicians who may use the research. Thus, the project has the capacity to benefit:

1. People who are high in IU. The research could impact the quality of life for individuals displaying high levels of IU, by informing interventions that help to alleviate uncertainty-induced anxiety in these individuals.

2. Clinicians working with patients who have anxiety disorders and high levels of IU. This research will provide new ideas about ways of approaching the treatment of anxiety disorders for patients who have high levels of IU.

3. Other professionals working with people with high IU, such as educators, employers, carers or charity workers. For example, people with high IU may face anxiety with: (1) starting new courses or employment and (2) in occupations where uncertainty is common (e.g. finance, stock market). Therefore, people with high IU may benefit from available support from councillors or occupational psychologists to reduce stress. Such support may facilitate smooth transitions in education and employment, easing the burden off professionals in these institutions. 

The final group of potential research users are public bodies such as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) who provide evidence-based guidance and advice for health practitioners. Before recommendations for guidelines and policy can be made however, potential interventions based on the outcomes of the proposed research would need to be developed and evaluated. Thus, impact for policy represents a long-term goal.","Jayne Morriss","Psychology","Cognitive Psychology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It is at the basis of our ability to bond with other people through effective interactions. A big challenge in psychology is to understand how empathy occurs. Since we cannot fully experience what someone else is feeling, we might use our own mind or general knowledge as a model to represent others' inner states. The aim of this project is to investigate whether we need to consciously reactivate our own autobiographical memories (AMs) to empathize with others' inner states.

Neuroimaging studies have shown that empathic abilities and AM partly share a brain network of fronto-parietal areas, suggesting that the two cognitive functions are related. One study conducted by the PI has shown that healthy participants use their own AMs of physical pain when they have to judge how much empathy they feel for someone else experiencing the same pain. Studies with patients with different kinds of memory impairments have additionally shown evidence of impoverished empathic abilities, further evidencing an interplay between memory and empathy. However, contrary to expectations based on these findings, purely amnesic patients do not show striking evidence of empathic impoverishment. Moreover, patients with congenital pain insensitivity have been found to share another person's pain even though they can never have experienced such pain.

The inconsistency in the field demonstrates that the nature of the interplay between AMs and empathy still remains elusive. The current project aims to determine whether the explicit recruitment of AMs is a resource needed when we empathize with others' emotional experience by identifying the underlying neurophysiological mechanism.

A series of two studies are designed on the novel hypothesis that the nature of the interplay between empathy and memory is causal such that when the observer, i.e. the participant, shares past experiences with the person currently having that experience (pain experience in this case), the observer can empathize with others' inner states by re-living the memory and so increasing their empathy awareness. The studies will be focused on determining whether AMs are explicitly reactivated when shared with the perceiver, in order to empathize with their inner states, and will clarify the circumstances under which memory disruption affects empathy. If these studies provide convergent evidence for the hypothesis, a third study will be piloted in healthy participants with the long-term aim to develop a brain stimulation therapy to improve empathy awareness in patients with memory impairments.

To address the central question, the studies will use an innovative combination of established and novel paradigm and analysis tools in the fields of social and cognitive neuroscience. The first experiment will directly test whether conscious reactivation of AMs occurs to empathize with others' physical pain by recording electroencephalographic (EEG) activity from amnesic patients. The second experiment will directly test the causality of such involvement in a group of healthy participants by recording EEG while concomitantly using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) to stimulate a cortical area responsible for the reactivation of AMs.

Together the results from these studies will provide a complementary picture of how AMs are involved in empathic processes and will determine if and how AMs are a resource needed to empathize with others' inner states. They will significantly advance our understanding of the interplay of two cognitive functions that have a huge influence on a person's interacting behavior. Therefore, the current project has the potential to impact a wide range of professions working with people in need in the health and social sectors, as well as the general public, which will be reached with public engagement activities.","As the project is basic and experimental in nature, its primary impact will be within the academic fields of basic psychological and neuroscientific research on empathy and AMs. However the project has strong potential, in the longer term, to impact outside of academia.

Firstly, since empathy and memory are two aspects of human cognition that have a broad impact on observed interacting behavior, the research could potentially be applied to clinical practices and to social contexts of integration and cooperation. In the long term, understanding the role of AMs in empathy may inform rehabilitation strategies for people with memory impairments. If the outcomes of the planned experiments are as predicted, this objective will be pursued through a pilot study that, as a first step, will test the efficacy of brain stimulation in boosting AM reactivation and so enhancing empathy in healthy participants.

Secondly, a more immediate impact will come from shaping discourse about the role of AMs in empathy in groups for whom this is of particular significance. Before starting her academic career, the PI worked in an antiviolence center for domestic violence victims and for a recognized non-profit NGO (EMERGENCY) that pursues human rights-based medicine. The present project will help in clarifying the impact of AMs on empathy, which is something that makes a huge difference on the daily practice, as the attitude of the operators has direct consequences on users' satisfaction and their relationship with the service. Therefore, the second group expected to benefit from the project are those working in the health (health professionals) and social works sectors.

Thirdly, the project is expected to have a significant impact on the PI's scientific work. The PI is a Marie-Curie fellow and the proposed series of studies naturally but innovatively proceeds from a coherent path of her academic and non-academic experiences. The project is therefore expected to build the PI's independent and novel network of national and international scholars and to train her on two main skills that will be crucial to establishing her new line of research: a new neuroscientific technique, the Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, and direct experience with a clinical population. The project will include a wide range of academic and impact activities that will also provide a significant improvement of the PI's communication skills.

Lastly, the general public will also be reached (see &quot;Pathways to Impact&quot;) with accessible information about how AMs constitute a resource to empathy. Our ability to empathize and remember are cornerstones of human cognition. Much debate surrounds when these abilities develop in children, the possible existence of some similar abilities in non-human animals, and why it is that some people seem to be better empathizers than others. I will use my research to spark broader discussion of these topics during live and online engagements with the public.","Federica Meconi","Psychology","Cognitive Psychology","Experimental Psychology","Psychology","Social Psychology",NA,NA,NA,NA

Indeed, women still comprise only 20% of technology positions at Google and only 7% of FTSE 100 CEOs in the UK. However, it is exactly these stereotypes and rigid ideas about gender differences endorsed by Damore - rather than a lack of natural abilities - that contributes to the underrepresentation of women in leadership and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math). To combat these gender stereotypes, many organisations have implemented a range of workplace diversity initiatives. 
Unfortunately, these initiatives, which typically have no evidence base, could themselves reinforce stereotypes, creating a vicious circle that maintains inequality. Like many organisations, Google highlights gender differences in many of its diversity initiatives, assuming that celebrating difference will benefit women (i.e., a gender-conscious approach). In this project, I suggest that, by highlighting gender differences, gender-conscious initiatives in particular send a tacit message that women are inherently different from men and that all women are similar. By doing so, they may further justify gender stereotypes, and thus women's underrepresentation in traditionally male domains. 
I will test these hypotheses, as well as also explore strategies to avoid these unintended consequences. First, gender-conscious approaches that explicitly acknowledge differences in the socialisation of men and women may help reduce people's tendency to attribute gender differences to innate factors. Second, gender-conscious approaches that embrace women's contributions, while also acknowledging that individual women vary, may reduce people's tendency to make generalisations across all women. 
In summary, this research project has the following aims: 
(1) Examine whether gender-conscious diversity approaches lead to gender stereotyping.
(2) Examine whether gender-conscious approaches deter people from appointing women to leadership and STEM positions.
(3) Test two strategies to alleviate negative consequences of gender-conscious approaches.
Indeed, empirical research on different types of diversity initiatives, including those taking a gender-conscious approach, is limited and inconclusive. I am well-suited to examine these questions because of my past and ongoing research testing when diversity initiatives can backfire, when they are beneficial, and when their efficacy is mixed. However, no research thus far has directly examined the relationship between gender-conscious initiatives and women's workplace outcomes. 
In collaboration with industry partners, I will conduct at least 7 studies across 3 phases of research using a range of methodologies and samples: experiments with working professionals in a range of industries and longitudinal field studies examining real-world outcomes with working professionals employed by my organisational partners. Across all phases, I will work with industry partners to develop the research questions and materials. In the final year, I will hold a workshop to disseminate the findings to partner organisations and key contacts in London. 
Better understanding the impact of gender-conscious approaches has clear applications because it could transform how organisations implement diversity initiatives. For example, organisations could more carefully consider the language used on their websites about gender equality and tailor diversity trainings to focus on the importance of both group and individual identity, rather than focusing primarily on women's unique contributions. Developing close industry connections during the research project will also facilitate future opportunities to test organisation-wide field interventions.","This engaged research project has clear potential for impact on societal gender equality. To ensure it has the intended impact, we will engage in co-production of knowledge with our partner organisations both during the development and dissemination stages of the research. Although we have outlined a clear set of objectives in this grant, our partner organisations will be essential for helping us design these studies in a way that reflects real organisational initiatives and tests strategies that could feasibly be implemented in organisations after completion of the grant research. We will disseminate the research broadly through the traditional university routes (e.g., the University of Exeter press office) and through our partner organisations (see Pathways to Impact for detailed information). We envisage both direct and indirect beneficiaries outside of the academic community:

1. Our partner organisations (listed in Pathways to Impact): This research will shed light on whether diversity initiatives assumed to be effective for reducing gender equality are beneficial, or whether they may instead backfire. It will also explore ways to reduce any unintended consequences in order to give organisations guidelines for adjusting their approaches - indeed, this research could transform how our partner organisations, most of which are major organisations listed on the FTSE 100 or Fortune 500, implement their diversity initiatives. Specifically, they can more carefully consider the language used on their websites about gender equality and the way diversity training interventions are implemented. For example, they could tailor diversity trainings to focus on the importance of both group and individual identity, rather than focusing primarily on the group level (i.e., women's unique contributions). Developing these close connections during the research project will also facilitate future research opportunities to test organisation-wide field interventions across different industries, even beyond the duration of this grant. 

2. Other international organisations and institutions interested in increasing gender equality: Because our partner organisations employ thousands of people globally and span a range of industries, changing norms within these organisations could influence the diversity initiatives implemented at other organisations as well through wide dissemination of the research and buy-in from those at high levels of our partner organisations. 

3. Diversity managers, human resources networks, and women's networks: Human resources networks, diversity managers, and organisational women's networks are clear beneficiaries who can use their influence to change organisational practices once they have evidence-based guidelines. Some of the relevant beneficiaries include the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, Business in the Community, the Professional Women's Network, the Women in Business Network, and the Diversity Group. 

4. Women and the general public more broadly: Diversity approaches do not only impact organisations - they permeate the culture of society and impact people's daily lives. Consider the extent to which the popular psychology book &quot;Men Are From Mars, Women are From Venus&quot; has pervaded popular culture and influenced conversations about gender differences. These ideas impact people's underlying understanding of gender and can then influence what roles they believe men and women should perform in society. The takeaway messages of my research about valuing women without reifying gender stereotypes could have a broader impact on society in terms of changing people's language around gender and differences. By disseminating this research to the general public through the media and popular science articles and talks (see Pathways to Impact), people may reconsider how their assumptions about gender can have a negative impact.","Teri Kirby","Psychology","Industrial-Org/Occupational","Psychology","Social Psychology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Sustainable Development Goal 4 calls on all governments to ensure that, by 2030, all children complete a basic education that is inclusive, equitable and of high quality. While much research has explored the ways that gender and the language-of-instruction separately present a challenge to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 4, there is an evidence gap about girls' learning in a dominant language, such as English. This study will address this gap through a mixed-methods case study of girls' learning in Rwandan upper primary and secondary education; the years of basic education where the language-of-instruction is English. 

Rwanda has been chosen as the case study as it is a country where gender parity has been achieved, if measured solely on access across the education cycle, but where girls are disadvantaged regarding measures of equity (e.g. significantly higher numbers repeating years) and quality (e.g. fewer girls passing national secondary examinations). English is the language-of-instruction from the fourth year of primary school and recent research has suggested that it is a significant barrier to learner participation and success in national examinations. It, therefore, provides an excellent case study to explore the potential ways that learning in English may be impacting on Rwandan girls' educational access, experiences and outcomes. The study will focus on girls in the final year of primary schooling (approximately 12 years old) and of lower secondary education (approximately 15 years old) - to enable snapshots of girls' experiences at these key transitional points in their basic education cycle.

The case study will be multi-level, mixed method and interdisciplinary, involving perspectives from sociology, education and applied linguistics. An initial contextualising phase will identify co-occurring trends between girls' learning metrics, gendered attitudes and the use of English Medium Instruction. This will be achieved through statistical analysis of national education statistics, household survey data (attitudinal survey responses) and girls' examination results in English (in lieu of any available national language proficiency test results). The trends identified will be triangulated through eight key stakeholder interviews with policymakers and practitioners related to girls' education and EMI. The main exploratory phase will focus on girls' experiences of learning in English, both in the classroom and other sites of learning (e.g. the home). Data from photo-linked interviewing with 48 girls from four schools, and classroom observations, will be thematically analysed to identify key inhibitors and facilitators for girls' learning in English. 

A relevant learning justice framework, which brings socio-cultural theories of learning within a gender justice framing, will be developed from this analysis and its applicability will be explored with relevant stakeholders through a range of workshops (including girls, teachers and national stakeholders). It is intended that implications for a more inclusive and equitable education for all in Rwanda, and across the Global South, will be co-constructed. These will be disseminated in national and global academic and policy networks through four journal articles, conference attendance, two advocacy videos and an extended policy brief. If national policy impact is achieved, the study will ultimately improve the learning experiences and outcomes for all girls in English Medium Rwandan basic education.","This study aims to improve the learning experiences and outcomes for girls in low income contexts by identifying the facilitators and inhibitors to learning for girls in English medium instruction. This will contribute significantly to the evidence base of ways to improve girls' transition through and completion of basic education with good learning outcomes and so has the potential for significant national and global impact. 

1. In Rwanda, the scope for policy impact relates to the successful implementation of the Rwandan Education Sector plan by the Rwandan Ministry of Education to achieve quality basic education for all. Potential evidence of such improvement would be seen in amendments to the language-in-education and girls' education policies, reform in pre-service and in-service teacher training so that teachers are able to better support girls' educational experiences and outcomes and/or more inclusive learning support materials that girls can access in and out of the classroom. If national policy impact is achieved, the study will ultimately improve the learning experiences and outcomes for all girls in English Medium Rwandan basic education. In 2016, there were 716,972 girls enrolled in upper primary and lower secondary education. Trajectories suggest that this number will rise, and this also does not include girls of basic education age who are not enrolled in schooling. Given the paucity of evidence in Rwanda of learning strategies that can support all children to learn English and access the wider curriculum in EMI classrooms, there is also potential that findings will be relevant for the similar number of boys in basic education. 

2. Further afield, findings can bring impact through the development and dissemination of more targeted and intersectional responses by bilateral agencies (e.g. the UK Department for International Development) and non-governmental organisations (e.g. the British Council) for girls' learning in EMI. If this impact is achieved, the study will make a contribution to the ultimate achievement of the Sustainable Development Goal 4 of inclusive and equitable quality basic education for all by 2030. This will have particular policy interest given the widening of basic education to lower secondary education, often a key point where girls can drop out or fail to transition to higher stages of education. If the findings show that there is a negative impact on girls of learning in English, there is also impact by adding weight to the evidence base and advocating for the importance of mother-tongued based multilingual education for the achievement of SDG4. 

The potential for this national and global impact has been factored into the design of the project from its inception throughout the life cycle with key stakeholders included as: research participants (through workshops in the confirmatory phase of the project that will focus on the policy changes needed to enable the recommendations from the research); co-investigators (to enable policy impact to be centrally considered in all aspects of the research design); and members of the advisory group (engaged throughout the project to consider the ways that findings can be policy-responsive). The research will be disseminated through a tailored extended policy brief and advocacy videos where the relevance of findings for wider concerns of learning in multilingual societies and girls' education will be promoted.","Alphonse UWORWABAYEHO","Education","Curriculum areas","Elements of Education","Phases of education","Sociology of Education",NA,NA,NA,NA

Research that has focused on public views of the causes of these differences suggests that, in general, people have well-developed understandings of the factors that contribute to health inequalities. People from communities across the UK have identified the range of upstream factors which influence their health and the health of those around them, including housing conditions, unemployment and lack of funding for communities and services. Despite both policymakers and public groups understanding these causes, limited progress has been made towards reducing health inequalities in Scotland or UK-wide. Citizens' views on this lack of progress, and their perceptions of potential policy measures which could reduce health inequalities, have not been explored in detail. Young people's perspectives on these issues are also not currently well understood. 

Media representations of health inequalities can negatively impact those communities and individuals most impacted by inequalities by furthering feelings of stigma or shame, related to the areas they live in being labelled deprived or disadvantaged. Calls for new qualitative research suggests that researchers should engage sensitively with the topic and avoid stigmatising language, but also aim to include diverse population groups to explore the consequences of inequality across society. Various models of research have been proposed to overcome some of these barriers, including participatory research which invites participants to actively shape projects and contribute to outputs alongside researchers. 

In order to develop our understanding of young people's views on health inequalities, this project involves working together with young people in Glasgow and Leeds, cities where reducing health inequalities is a priority. Creative organisations (Impact Arts in Glasgow and Opera North in Leeds), who have contributed to the development of this project, will facilitate the engagement of groups of young people in several workshop sessions. These sessions will be led by researchers and creative partners, who are experienced in delivering creative engagement events with groups of the public, to explore the causes and consequences of health inequalities. Participants will also be supported to discuss their perspectives on potential policy solutions, pursuing those issues which they prioritise as most important or most relevant to their lives, communities or peers. Over the course of the sessions participants will also engage in creative processes to produce artistic outputs that reflect their perspectives on the enduring public health problem of health inequalities. These creative outputs will provide the focus for a series of engagement events and workshops with representatives from local government, health boards, third sector organisations and local communities. By generating new insights and creative representations of these, young people will be facilitated to actively contribute to ongoing policy discussions about the reduction of social inequalities in health across both local and national contexts.","Policy decision-makers: Creation of the advisory group in the early stages of the project will allow for key input from policy decision-makers (including local and national government representatives and public health bodies) in the design of the project. Meetings of this group will aim to identify opportunities for young people to engage directly with policy priorities related to health inequalities - e.g. those proposed in The Life Chances of Young People in Scotland, A Report to the First Minister (Eisenstadt, 2017). Project progress will be communicated in monthly updates sent by email, and through online communications (blogs and project-specific social media content). The advisory group members will be joined by additional local and national decision-makers, identified by young people, at showcase events planned by participants. Decision-makers will also be invited to workshops in Glasgow and Leeds to discuss research findings. These events will facilitate prolonged engagement with the outputs of the research. More formal presentations will be made to wider audiences of policymakers at meetings of groups like the Scottish Parliament cross-party group on health inequalities, and similar groups in Westminster and Northern England. Insights are particularly relevant to decision-makers who identified health inequalities as a priority issue in Glasgow and Leeds, particularly given that lack of public support is often cited as a barrier to developing evidence-informed policy among decision-makers (Smith 2013). 

Advocacy groups: Representatives from advocacy groups (e.g. Poverty alliance, The Equality Trust) and third sector organisations with an interest in health inequalities will also be invited to inform project development by joining the advisory group and attend dissemination meetings and workshops. Developing relationships with advocacy organisations will also provide a platform for dissemination of young people's creative outputs beyond the length of the project. Depending on participants' preferences artworks (or visual/audio/online content) could be shared with organisations for use in ongoing advocacy work.

Participants: A diverse mix of young people, some of whom are not in education, training or employment, will be engaged in the project. Engaging these young people will be led by Impact Arts whose programme includes working with young people in Scotland's most deprived areas. The aim of this work is to engage with young people through arts-based activities to increase confidence, contribute to wellbeing, and improve employability. These outcomes will be considered throughout development of the data collection phase, session plans and process for generating creative outputs. Evaluation of the outcomes for young people will be measured by Impact Arts. Importantly, at the close of the project, young people will be invited (in both sites) to continue to engage with Impact Arts or Opera North in longer term programmes. 

Wider community groups: A key aim of dissemination events will be to engage with the wider community in each group's area. Depending on participants' preferences on delivery, this could involve inviting local school groups to engage in workshops on the social determinants of health, or creating launch events which run over afternoons and evenings so members of the community can engage with creative outputs of the research.

Impact Arts and Opera North: The two creative partner organisations will acts as co-facilitators of Development Phase workshops, and will develop new connections to both social and public health researchers and policymakers (local and national) with an interest in health inequalities. Both organisations will be invited to engage in broader knowledge exchange activities, including ongoing communication with the Advisory Group, co-authored publications, and through face-to-face meetings and events with wider stakeholders, including communities and policy decision-makers.","Katherine Smith","Social Policy","Sociology","Visual arts","Applied Arts HTP","Med Soc/Soc Health & Illness","Social Policy",NA,NA,NA

The study arises from an on-going AHRC impact project that indicates the potential of such work for developing global citizenship amongst young people. It will comprise a cross-cultural, multiple case, ethnographic study investigating 6 projects in the United Kingdom (UK) and South Africa (SA) across 30 months. In a political and economic climate of instability, scarce resources, and global movements of people, this timely research will inform urgent international conversations about citizenship, particularly those relating global citizenship education (GCE) to ESD. 
 Sustainable use of water resources is fundamental to human survival and a focus of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Hydro-sociology is an emerging discourse within the science of water systems that pays attention to the urgent need to understand them as coupled to human systems. Studies show that pressures on and behaviour of water systems in the Anthropocene are linked to human activity. Research identifies a global water crisis resulting in 80% of the world's population predicted to suffer water stress by 2050. Worldwide, communities are responding to these threats and the associated problems caused by rapid economic development (e.g. industrial effluent, plastic pollution) through community-based approaches to waterway rehabilitation. We propose to make these our focus, aiming to study how and to what extent ESD through community engagement with waterway rehabilitation contributes to young people's civic learning and multi-level political agency. 
Primary objectives:
1. To explore how ESD in waterway rehabilitation projects contributes to young people's developing attributes for global citizenship, using the cross-cultural comparison between the UK and SA to elucidate how this occurs.
2. To develop detailed, rich descriptions of the projects (including as infographic case portraits) to illustrate some strategies community-based waterway rehabilitation projects employ to achieve their ends of improving waterway health in diverse cultural contexts. 
Our research will comprise 3 phases. Phase 1 develops a detailed demographic description of project localities, drawing on existing census data sets and creating new data through door to door surveys using an innovative paired researcher technique. Phase 2 includes observations of project activities and walk-and-talk interviews with project members. Phase 3 analyses the data thematically, drawing on literature and field experience to achieve our objectives. 
We will co-author academic articles and produce innovative online infographic case portraits to share the research outcomes. The research cycle will culminate in an international conference with practitioner walk-shops and knowledge exchange sessions. 
The research team will comprise the applicant as principal investigator (PI), a research assistant (RA) with hydropolitical expertise and a mentor from within the PI's chosen institution (Faculty of Education, University of Cambridge), and community-based paired researchers. CW2GC will provide the PI with crucial capacity building opportunities including developing knowledge and innovative community research methods, and learning knowledge mobilisation strategies. The experience of leading a project, including managing data and ethical procedures will be a foundation for the PI to build a career studying vital issues with global significance. The ambitious and targeted plans for scholarly outputs and the mentor co-authoring of papers will be career-defining for both PI and RA","Here we focus on academic, policy and third sector targets of this work. (See 'Pathways to Impact' for mechanisms to achieve impact) 
1. Academic communities - fields of environmental and sustainability education, sociohydrology, hydropolitics, the sociology of community-based education initiatives, and citizenship education. Knowledge outputs might influence the natural sciences, e.g. academic communities working on biodiversity (see 'academic beneficiaries') 
2. Policy - The study is designed to have policy implications at multiple levels. The aim is to contribute to ongoing international efforts by intergovernmental organisations such as UNESCO to further understanding about civic learning for a global citizenry through delineating the political, social and cultural issues underpinning participation in environmental actions like efforts to improve access to and quality of local waterways; and understanding the learning that engaging with these issues engenders in schools and communities (e.g. understanding local governance structures); and how this influences participants' active citizenship at multiple levels. Additionally, we aim to influence how countries address their commitments to the UNSDGs; specifically, but not limited to: Goal 3 (Health and Wellbeing), Goal 4 (Quality Education), specifically Target 4.7 that refers to ESD, Goal 6 (Water and Sanitation) and Goal 17 (Partnerships for the Goals). Whilst the SDGs have high-level support from governments around the world, their achievement relies on the commitment of individuals and communities, and community-based initiatives of this kind are crucial to their success. However, some goals conflict and this research might reveal some of these conflicts, so the study may contribute to meliorating these problems. 
At the national level in SA and the UK, this research has medium and long term implications for educational policy (e.g. the citizenship and natural sciences curriculum) and environmental policy (e.g. resource use and preservation). Locally, case study reports arising from this work might influence local government infrastructure management and maintenance, thus improving knowledge exchange between voluntary groups and local governance. It might influence school programmes of study, improving school-community interfacing and developing curricula with community groups and volunteers inspired by local environmental issues; with indirect benefits for environments and their non-human inhabitants (economically and physically), and for political participation in local governments. 
3. Practitioners in waterway rehabilitation projects of the participating organisations will learn from each other through cross-cultural networking, knowledge interchanges, infographic GIS case study portraits, and through exposure to the process of academic research and the entailed access to academic knowledge. Young people who act as community-based co-researchers will have improved chances to access employment. 
4. Waterway community inhabitants will benefit in the short and long term as it may consolidate and enhance the projects' successes in achieving waterway rehabilitation. Improvements in the condition and aspects of the waterway environments will have direct health and economic benefits (including improved mental health). 
5. Physical environments and habitats may benefit from this research, which will contribute to the case study projects' efforts to improve indigenous biodiversity, knowledge of which will be disseminated widely to other such projects around of the world via the online infographic GIS case study portraits. 
6. Water security may benefit which aims to support efforts to find solutions to an emerging crisis that puts 80% of the world's population at water risk.
